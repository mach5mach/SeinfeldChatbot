I have to tell you that I did some very exciting news recently,          and I don't know if I should really tell you exactly what it is because          it's really not a definite thing yet. Well, I will tell you what I know          so far. According to the information that I have in the envelope that          I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable          prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very          nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know          I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am          among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what          annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with          that, "You may have already won." I'd like once for a sweepstakes          company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the          truth one time. Send out envelopes, "You have definitely lost!"          You turn it over, giant printing, "Not even close!" You open          it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, "Even we cannot          believe how badly you've done in this contest."  (Trying to get the box through the door. To Kramer) To the right.          (They get it through)  (Sarcastic) Don't get up.  Since my grandfather died. I was suppose to send it down to my          parents in Florida, but they didn't want it. They told me to get rid of          it, but I felt funny and then I sort of forgot about it. And it's been          sitting down there for three years.. until he saw it. (To Kramer) Alright,          so, just take what you want and let's get it out of here.  Grandpa clothes. I can't wear them.  No, go ahead. (Looks around his apartment) Look at this place.          I can't wait to get it cleaned.  No, Elaine got this writer friend from Finland, Rava. Her boyfriend          goes to Columbia grad school, and he's suppose to do it.  How long have you been waiting to squeeze that into a conversation?  What?  (Stepping in) Spread out, spread out you numbskulls. Why don't          you just settle it like mature adults?  Inka-dink, a bottle of ink. The cork fell out, and you stink.          Not because you're dirty, not because you're clean - just because you          kissed the girl behind the magazine.. (He lands on Kramer, then completes          the rhyme) And you are it! (Lands on George)  No, he's it. He wins. "It" is good.  No, no, no, come on, Kramer. Now, you got the socks.  Alright, c'mon. Let's go.  Come on, let's go. (They go to the door. George sets the statue          down) Aren't you gonna take it?  Alright, let's go. Hey, you know, you owe me one.  The Inka-dink.. you were "It".  "It" very bad.  (Frantic) So, where's this boyfriend of yours? I can't wait much          longer. I've got a flight.  (Joking) So what do you write, children's books?  (Taken aback) ..Alright.  (Rushed) I gotta get to the airport.  The toilet brush is under the sink.. (Exits)  I don't really feel that comfortable with a maid, either, because          there's that guilt when you have someone cleaning your house. You know,          you're sitting there on your sofa, and they go by with the vacuum, "I'm          really sorry about this. I don't know why I let that stuff over there."          And that's why I could never be a maid, because I'd have an attitude.          I'd find them, whereever they are in the house, "Oh, I suppose you          couldn't do this? No, don't get up, let me clean up your filth. No, you          couldn't dust. No, this is too tough, isn't it?"  He really did an amazing job, look! He uncoagulated the top of          the dishwashing liquid. (Opens refrigerator) He cleaned out the bottom          of the little egg cups. Come here, look at this. (Gets on his knees) He          cleaned the little one-inch area between the refrigerator and the counter.          How did he get in there? He must be like Rubber Man!  ..Why did I think there was a Rubber Man? There's Elastic Man          and Plastic Man.  Where are you going?  Wait. I'll go with you. (They both go tward the door. Jerry opens          it) Elaine, he Windexed the little peep hole! (The leave)  Hey, Ray, listen, you really did a tremendous job cleaning that          apartment.  (Joking about his personality) Shouldn't you be out on a ledge          somewhere?  (Snaps out of it) What?  (Points to the statue) I think that's the statue from my house.          That looks like the statue from my house!  I had a statue!  My grandfather gave me a statue!  What's the difference?! That's the one! He ripped me off! This          guy ripped me off!  I can't believe it! This guy ripped me off!  Yes! This guy ripped me off! He stole that statue right out of          my house!  Pretty sure! Ninety-nine percent sure.  Coincidence? This guy's in my apartment and then, just by coincidence,          he has the same exact statue in his apartment.  I had a statue! What should I do?  ..I'll call Kramer. He can check my house. (Grabs the phone, and          dials)  Don't worry.. (Whispering into the phone) Kramer! Kramer!.. It's          Jerry!.. Jerry! .. from next door!.. Never mind where I am!.. Yes, Jerry          Seinfeld!.. (Rava enters with a manuscript. Jerry starts talking casually)  Ma, I told ya, just dip the bread in the batter, and put in right          in the pan. Okay, bye. (Hangs up) My mother.. She forgot how to make French          Toast. You know how mothers are.  My mom's down in Florida.. she's go one of those condos.. Hot          down there in the summer. You ever been down there?  ..Listen, I just remembered.. I'm ..uh, getting a facial.  No, I don't eat dinner. Dinner's for suckers. (They leave)  (On the phone) Uh huh.. yeah.. Okay, thanks anyway. Bye. (Hangs          up) Nope, the cop says it's my word against his. There's nothing they          can do.  Yeah, right.  Do you realize how crazy he had to be to do something like this?          He knew I was gonna know it's missing, and he took it! And of all things          to take - I left my watch, tape recorder, stereo. He's crazy.  I'll call him. (Picks up the cordless phone. Kramer, George, and          Elaine all struggle for control of the other - so they can listen in on          the conversation. As Jerry's talking, the three others still fight) Hello,          Ray? ..Hi, Ray, this is Rava's friend, Elaine's frined, Jerry.. The King          of Comedy.. right. Listen, you know that statue on your mantle, the one          with the blue lady? (To Kramer and George) Will you shut up?! (To Ray)          Yeah, you don't want to talk about it over the phone? You don't want Rava          to hear? ..Yeah, I understand.. You know that coffee shop near my house,          Monk's? ..Alright, tomarrow. One o' clock. Great, okay, bye. (Hangs up)  Relax, he's late. He's always late. It's part of his "M.O."  Yeah, yeah.. don't worry about it.  (Sarcastic) That's comforting.. Shh. He's here. (Greeting him)          Ray?  ..Well, I didn't..  Well, just give it back, and I won't say anything.  Yeah.  What are you talking about?  Yeah, me too.  Me.  Yeah. Me.  Ray, I had a statue in my house. You were in my house - and then          I saw it in your house.  What am I saying?  Well, I..  I can't believe what I'm hearing.  A pawn shop?  Oh, excuse me.. Look, Ray, you were the only person in my house.  (Joking) No, she's a little too cheery for me.  I know Finland. They're neutral.  No, I actually find you quite charming.. a bit verbose at times.  (To George) Did you call me a wuss?  I said luss.. I'm at a luss..  That's not necessary. (George slams his menu down on the table          in anger) You know, maybe it's not that bad an idea.  (Pleading) George.  (Still pleading) George, george..  Hey, Ray.  How did you get the goop out of the top of the dishwashing liquid?          It was like a brand-new nozzle!  Really?  Can't you talk to your boss?  Well, perhaps we can take comfort in the knowledge that in the          next world, Ray will be the recipient of a much larger and more harsh          brand of justice..  Alright, alright. What's the big hubbub, bub?  Kramer, what did you do?  People are going to steal from you. You can't stop them. But,          everybody has their own little personal security things - things that          they think will foil the crooks, you know? In your own mind, right? ..You          go to the beach, go in the water, put your wallet in the sneaker. Who's          gonna know? What criminal mind could penetrate this fortress of security?          I tied a bow. They can't get through that. I put the wallet down by the          toe of the sneaker. They never look there. They check the heel, they move          on.  (Gets up) Get out!  (Looks around his apartment) Is it better than                mine?  So, it's a two-bedroom-one-bath-make-your-friends-hate-ya?  She's out.  Yeah, well, they like to call it a set-up now.                I guess the blind people don't like being associated with all those                losers.  I can't. I'm meeting Kramer down at my mini-storage.  (Grabs his coat) Oh, this is really annoying.  (Disgusted) What is with that?!  (Takes out his key to unlock the unit door)                Where is your key?  You know, Kramer, I rented out half of my space                to you.  (Picks one up) Mail bags? He's storing mail                in here?  (Talking to Elaine) You ate more bread?  Did you find out who stabbed him?  (Like a father) Well, you're not going near                this hooligan anymore.  (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad he didn't get shot.                He could have been the one.  There is now. Kramer, you should really get                that cough checked out by a doctor.  (In awe. Whispering) The botched it?  Hey. How's the new place?!  (Correcting her) Edmund Fitzgerald.  (Gives Elaine a look) No, Gordon Lightfoot                was the singer. Edmund Fitzgerald was the ship.  (Sarcastic) Yeah, and it was rammed by the                Cat Stevens.  Hey, uh, before you go, did you talk to Newman                about getting that mail outta there?  Newman?  Listen, I want you to get the mail outta my                storage unit.  (Confused) What are you talking about?  "Transfer"?  You quit the post office?  Well, get it out of my storage. It's illegal.  (Cheerfully) Well, a law's a law. (Leaves)  There was another crazed ex-girlfriend?  Mmm.. Bad how?  (Nods) I follow. So what are you gonna do?  (Agreeing) What's more important?  You know, if this tenant board is so impressed                with suffering, maybe you should tell them the "Astonishing                Tales of Costanza".  I mean, your body of work in this field is                unparalleled.  You're the man!  I'm with people, I'll be with you in a moment.                (Slams the door on Newman's face. Then tries to delay talking to                Newman by keeping the conversation with  (Angered) Hello.. Newman.  What's the difference?  Well, go ahead. There's 8 bags of it.  You're giving up that easy?  (Stopping him) No, wait a minute, Newman! You                can't let this dream die. You moving away is my dream too!  (Fast) Whatever it takes, for as long as it                takes me, where ever it takes me as long as it takes you away from                me!  (Confirming) An alliance. (They both shake                hands and laugh evily) Now get the hell outta here. (Newman leaves)  (Like an Army general) Elaine, Newman is my                sworn enemy. And he lives down the hall from my home - my home,                Elaine! Where I sleep, where I come to  "Big head" (Scoffs) That's almost                a compliment.  Hello?  Hey, George.  You can't make it?  Alright. (Hangs up)  (Saddened) Doesn't look like it's gonna happen.  Kramer, aren't you taking any medication for                that?  (Takes the bottle from him) Just swallow 'em.  Alright, sit down, sit down. (Grabs a pill                from the bottle, and starts advancing tward Kramer - like an owner                with his dog)  C'mon. Just sit down!  Sit down! Sit down!  Lean your head back. Open your mouth! (Grabs                Kramer's head) Open your mouth! Open it! Open it!  (Reads the pill bottle) What kind of pills                are these, anyways?! "For Smuckers"? "May cause panting                and loss of fur"? (Turns to Kramer) These are dog  But, he's a dog! You need to see a real doctor.  Alright.. (Heads for the door, grabbing his                coat)  I'm taking the car. I gotta run some errands.                You want to go?  (Opens the door) C'mon, you wanna go for a                ride? (Starts jiggling his keys - as if he's calling out for a dog)                Huh? C'mon! C'mon!  Kramer, outta the car. Out, now!  Alright, that's it.. (Grabs Kramer, trying                to pull him out of the car)  Hey, hey! Get back over here! Kramer! Get over                here! You are bad! Bad neighbor! Kramer!  Newman, how'd it go? Did you get it all delivered?                (Sees the pac) What happened?  Bit you?!  (Bravely) Well, what if I deliver it?  Well, why not?  What am I gonna wear?  (Excited) I can't believe I'm gonna be a mailman!  (Hands him some mail) There you go. Merry Chirstmas!  (Shrugs) Oops. (Continues walking along the                route, whistling. Hands a newspaper to a homeless bum on the street,                then keeps walking)  Hey, I've been trying to jam stuff in the box,                like you told me, but sometimes it says, like, "Photographs                - Do not bend".  What?  How did they know?!  (Pleading) I tried my best!  You know, this is your coat.  Boy, he didn't know what he was up against.                (George laughs) So, when do you move into the apartment?  What's the matter with you?  What giant freak-head?  So, it's actually gotten to you? You're playing                right into his hands!  (Casually, sarcastic) Either way.  We're dead.  We are dead.  All day tomorrow? We had a month and a half to come up with                something and we didn't do anything.  Let me ask you something. When's the last time you went                skiing?  I think you can take the lift ticket off your jacket now.  So what? You can't meet anybody. You're going on with Susan.  Hey, see those two women over there? I almost dated the                one on the right. She's in the closet business.  What is it your business?  She reorganizes your closet and shows you how to maximize                your closet space. She looked into my closet.  Yeah.  So, she mentioned she had a boyfriend and then it hit me.                What do I need more closet space for? (Across the room) Hi, Marla.  George, Marla.  Stacey.  George, Stacey.  George.  Trip to Berlin?  Oh, right, right.  Yes, yes, I did. But, you know, I was watching it on CNN,                and they covered it so well I thought, "Why knock my brains                out?"  Really?  Oh, did he like it?  So, are you gonna go out with her?  What about Susan?  Depends.  On many factors.  Well, how long you've been seeing her. What's your phone                call frequency? Are you on a daily?  What about Saturday nights? Do you have to ask her out,                or is a date implied?  She got anything in your medicine cabinet?  Ah hah. Let me ask you this. Is there any tampax in your                house?  Well, I'll tell you what you've got here.  You got yourself a girlfriend.  I'm looking at a guy in a semi-daily with tampax in his                house and an implied date on Saturday night. I would like to help                you out, but...  You're going to make a good father someday.  Fine. Break up with her. But you know what this means?  The script, the pilot, the TV show. That's all over.  Figure it out. She's one of the executives at NBC that's                gonna make the decision whether or not they pick up the show. She's                one of our biggest fans. You drop her off, you think they're gonna                pick us up?  you know, it's a very interesting situation. Here you have                a job that can get you girls. But, you also have a relationship.                But if you try and get rid of the relationship so you can get the                girls, you lose the job. You see the irony?  (sarcastically) Oh, yeah.  This is your plan?  I don't think you are.  Please, and be brutal. I have no closet sensitivity.  I don't think I am.  Try me.  Everything?  You're quite mad, you know. (Kramer enters) Oh, I don't                believe this. (Goes into other room) Hey?  What are you doing?  No.  This is not a good time.  What did you have to give your TV away to George for?  Yeah, but now you're in here all the time. (Marla enters                from other room)  Marla, Kramer.  Why don't you go out? It's nice out.  There's weather.  I'm tellin' George to give you your TV back.  I don't know.  Kramer... (points to Marla)  So your boyfriend never came back from Berlin.  Oh, you must have been devastated being left for a wall.  Ah hah. (Buzzer) Excuse me one second. Yeah?  Come on up. Oh, it's Elaine, she's just a friend of mine.                I don't know what she's doing here now. (Buzzer) I'm sorry. What?  Ugh. So you were saying there was this problem.  Snapple?  Go on.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hi, um. Marla, Elaine.  Oh, thanks a lot, two weeks late. Now that costs me thirty-five                dollars to see Havana.  I like that thing in your hair there.  So we'll talk about the hooks then?  She's a virgin, she just told me.  Well it's not like spotting a toupee.  No, no, I mean...  Elaine, Elaine... (Buzzer) Yeah?  A virgin.  I don't know. I'm very attracted to her. That accent, it's                so sexy.  You need a little pioneer spirit. You know, you don't have                any of that Lewis and Clark in you.  Yeah, me too.  All right, but then we gotta get some work done. Let me                just call Kramer, see if want anything. (Calls) Hey, we ordering                Chinese food. If you want anything-- (Kramer enters quickly) let                me know what it is and I'll order for you.  All right, let's go. We don't have much time before the                meeting.   Don't worry, he'll be here. Look, we only got about two                hours. We just need to come up with one good story so we can get                through this meeting. (Buzzer) There's your food.  Yeah.  Your butler?  What about me?  (Getting the door) That's the stupidest idea I ever heard.                Sentenced to be a butler. (Elaine, Marla, and an injured Ping are                at the door) Ping, what happened?  What happened?  Should I call an ambulance? Do you wanna see a doctor?  Yeah, here.  (To George) You're givin' him back that TV.  A month and a half we had. We did nothing. I can't believe                we put it off until today and then we couldn't do anything because                Elaine runs out to apologize to a virgin, crosses against a light,                and knocks over a Chinese delivery boy. Now we're gonna make fools                of ourselves, we got nothing. You're not even in show business.                I gotta reputation. You drag me into the sewer with you. I've been                on TV buddy boy. You know how fast word spreads in show business?                It's like that (Snaps in George's face) , like that! One bad impression,                you're outta the business!  What do you mean? They know we're here.  No, no, would you get up?  No.  What?  Yes, I was very wise to hitch my wagon to his star. (Jerry                enters meeting)  Hi, how are you doing? Nice to see you all here. Hello.  Oh, uh, nice to meet you. Where's Russell?  Oh, poor Blossom. (He sits)  Oh, he ran to say something to David Letterman.  Yeah, he just walked by.   Yeah, good idea.  Good, good, we've got a lot of ideas.  Have you ever been to a Chinese restaurant and they tell                you it'll be, like, five minutes for a table and you wind up waitin'                there for, like, thirty minutes? Well, we thought it would be very                funny to do an entire show where all you're doin' is waitin' for                the table. (They don't seem to like it) Because we've all been in                that situation. You know, you're waiting... and you're hungry...                and you bump into somebody you know... When is Russell coming back?  Well no, that's one. We have many others. We have an idea                where, uh, I get into an accident with a guy who has no insurance                and the judge sentences him to be my butler. (Everyone laughs) You                know he cooks for me, he has to cook for me... He cleans my house,                he's doin' my shopping, you know? I'm walkin' around with one of                those big neck collars.  Don't worry, uh, we'll find something for you.  So Letterman didn't spark to your idea, huh?  Would you give him the TV back?  Why did he fire her?  You can't break up with her now. Her life is shattered.                You got her fired. You gotta be there for her.  You gotta at least wait until she gets another job.  Couple of interviews.  What? Leave? Where? Why?  Why would I leave? This is my apartment.  Who gave you this idea I would wanna leave?  Listen, I wouldn't put too much stock into what Elaine has                to say about relationships. She comes from a broken home, and I                mean that literally. A tree fell on her roof and cracked the whole                structure. Her parents got along beautifully, but her house was                in bad shape.  What else did you say to her?  More like a dope was giving it to her straight. Another                cup of coffee with you, she'll wind up in a convent.  What is that about leaving after sex? Did I ever leave with                you?  I was trying to be.  Oh, you're not kiddin'. Who'd 've figured Susan would break                up with him? They had a good thing going.  Why are we flyin' over the Andes?  Kramer.  No.  Kramer's got more muscle, higher protein content.                It's better for you.  That's very nice, I guess.  Look, if other people are having some, I'll                try you.  Can I have a piece of that?  Six weeks?  Well, so what? you've gone six weeks before.  Well, so, are you gonna break up with her?  What guys?  Yeah.  I thought the whole dream of dating a doctor                was debunked.  Isn't bunk bad? Like, that's a lot of bunk.  What?  Hello?  Oh hi, Katie.  I've heard of Ohio, Katie. But Tuesday's no                good. I'm doin' career day at my old junior high.  Yes, all right, Katie.  Yes, bye.  Yeah, it's no big deal.  And you were integral.  I'm on next, right?  The guy with the lizard.  I'm getting bumped? You're bumping me from                career day?  So you're enjoying the not enjoying.  I'm finding that out. (Kramer enters)  Ah, I didn't get on. The lizard guy went long.  It was a mix-up, I'm sure.  Now why would a junior high school want to                screw with my head?  You can make all the laws you want, he's still                gonna bother people.  No, let's just do it. (Fire alarm goes off)                What? What is going on? What is that about?  But I was promised this slot.  Fire drill, can you believe that?  Like fire in a school is such a big deal. (Kramer                enters)  Middle drawer.  Hello?  Oh hi, Katie.  Oh relax, Katie. It's not a problem.  No, I don't have any ashtrays.  No, Katie, don't-- (He hangs up phone)  Is this a repeat?  Louise! That's what's doin' it. You're no longer                pre-occupied with sex, so your mind is able to focus.  Yeah. I mean, let's say this is your brain.                (Holds lettuce head) Okay, from what I know about you, your brain                consists of two parts: the intellect, represented here (Pulls off                tiny piece of lettuce), and the part obsessed with sex. (Shows large                piece) Now granted, you have extracted an astonishing amount from                this little scrap. But with no-sex-Louise, this previously useless                lump, is now functioning for the first time in its existence. (Eats                tiny piece of lettuce)  What is goin' on in there?  Why?  It doesn't?  why not?   All right.               Hey. Wh-What'd you got, a smoker's lounge in                there?  I was out.  An assembly?  I understand. But what am I gonna talk about                for two hours?  Superfreak?  ...so if you like to tell jokes, and love to                make people laugh, stand-up comedy may be the career for you.  How am I gonna fill two hours?  And give you the chance to see some real disappointed                kids. (Waitress comes to table)  Are you all right?  Wait a second, I know what's happening. The                no sex thing is having a reverse effect on you.  To a woman, sex is like the garbage man. You                just take for granted the fact that any time you put some trash                out on the street, a guy in a jumpsuit's gonna come along and pick                it up. But now, it's like a garbage strike. The bags are piling                up in your head. The sidewalk is blocked. Nothing's getting through.                You're stupid.  Exactly.  Hey.  What? What happened to your face? It looks                like an old catcher's mitt.  It's from all that smoke. You've experienced                a lifetime of smoking in 72 hours. What did you expect?  And your teeth, your teeth are all brown.  So what did you do?  But ultimately, you're gonna choose in favor                of sex, right?  You mean, not subjecting yourself to your sexual                advances.  So you're never gonna have sex again?  So you ready for the assembly tomorrow? You                know what you're gonna say about the Yankees?  I wrote a 20 minute bit about how homework                stinks.  How ya doin'?  Well, don't worry about it. Once he passes                the test, you'll have sex again, and you'll be fine.  What for? Oh come on.  I think it has something to do with me.  (thinks about it for a second as to reconsider)                No, no, no. I'm sorry, it's too weird.  Where have you been? You know, you're on next.  Got lost? We went to school here for three                years.  Oh my God. You had sex. You had sex with Louise!  The Portuguese waitress?  Then what'd you come down here for?  It's good to have you back.  All right, I'll do it. (Goes on stage) Hey                kids. What's the deal with homework? you're not working on your                home! (Audience boos)  Cancelled? But I was supposed to be on tomorrow                night.  Actually, it was a ********.  Jerry.  (To Elaine) Let me ask you a question.  You're a hostage, captured by terrorists-  You, anybody - whatever. You're in the little room, you're                chained to the floor, you're there for a long time.. do you think                they would ever consider doing  (To George) What's the matter?  "Caught" you? Doing what?  Where?  "Glamour"?  So, what did she do?  What did you do?  (In the middle of Elaine's sentence, smiling) No, I wouldn't                think so.  "Glamour"?  (Skeptical) Ohhh yeah.. right.  No chance.  Well, I know I could hold out longer than you.  Sure, how much?  (Pointing) You're on.  You?  You'll be out before we get the check.  (Showing difference) It's apples and oranges..  Because you're a woman!  It's easier for a woman not to do it than a man.  We have to do it. It's part of our lifestyle. It's like,                uh.. shaving.  (Nodding) Okay, one-fifty.  Well, obviously, we all know each other very well, (Elaine                slightly laughs) I'm sure that we'll all feel comfortable within                the confines of the honor system.  (Waits for the rest of the sentence) ..Yeah?  How is she?  (Answering to the intercom) Yeah?  Come on up. (Lets her in by unlocking the front door)  (Opens his door slightly for Elaine) Dating Marla.  Yeah.  Well, I got my troops amassed along the border - I'm just                waiting for someone to give me the go-ahead.  Where?  (Also amazed) Who walks around the house like that?!  Hey, let me ask you a question. In these nudist colonies,                do they eat naked in the dining room?  What about the chamber maids? Are they naked, too?  (Over his shoulder) Not me.  There's a naked woman across the street.  (Commenting) Yeah.. the - the waitress should've taken it                back.  (Still staring at the woman) Uh-huh.  Well, it was that woman across the street. (To Jerry) You                know, you better be careful, buddy. She's gonna get you next. (Walks                out, shutting the door  "Slow it down"?  Ah, yeah.. I know.  Yeah, yeah.. of course. What, do you think I care about                the sex? What kind of person do you think I am? That doesn't mean                anything to me. (Faint) I don't  (Smiling, nodding) Sure, Saturday night.  Goodnight. (She gets out. Jerry leans forward, adding) Not                just a good night - a great night. (She shuts the door, he waves)  (Out of it) Yeah, good morning.  She's not there. She's doin' her wash.  (Over the top) Yes, I'm proud to say I did!  (Nodding) Yes. Yes I am. (Kramer chuckles) Master of my                domain. But I will tell you this: I am going over to (Gestures to                the nudist) her apartment, and  I can't take it anymore! She's driving me crazy! I can't                sleep, I can't leave the house, and I' here, I'm climbin' the walls.                Meanwhile, I'm dating a virgin, I'm in  (Persistent) Well, I'm doin' it, get out of my way.  Look, I'm sorry-  Kramer, (Trying to pass him) get outta my way!  Alright.. (Takes his coat off)  ..Alright.  She's not there!  So the nurse was giving her a sponge bath?  Oh, man. Well, I guess you'll be going back to that hospital.  (Pointing) But are you still master of your domain?  Lord of the manor.  What?  Really? Did you talk to him?  (Adding, fake praise) Good one.  But the question is, are you still master of your domain?  Alright, Ma, I'll talk to you later.. Nothing, I'm, I'm                watching, uh, Tiny Toons here, on Nickelodeon.. It's, I-I like kid                shows. They have a very innocent,  (Trying to block out Kramer, he starts to sing along with                the TV) The wheels on the bus go round and round, round and round,                round and round. The  I don't keep real coffee in here, I get my coffee on the                outside! (Intercom buzzes. He answers it) Yeah?!  (Shouting) Come on up! (Opens his door for Elaine)  I don't know.  How are these your socks?!  (Sarcastic) Oh, yeah, that's right, well, you fell asleep                one day on the sofa and I took them off your stinkin' feet. They                looked so good to me, I just had to  They're my socks!  What are we doing here..  This is ridiculous.  I haven't been myself lately. I've been snapping at everybody.  It's over?  Ohh-my-God. The Queen is dead.  What happened?  But you made it through the day before.  Why outside here?  Alright, Costanza - it's just you and me.  Really?  You sure?  You really want to?  Okay..  (Chuckles) You don't know the half of it.  Well, it's kinda silly, but..  No, it was just a bet. I mean, it actually started with                George and his mother-  I told her about the contest.  Marla?  (Moving to the window, shocked) Oh my God in heaven!  Why were you making gravel?  Of course. It's garbage.  Yeah, at least in the dumpster behind the Smithsonian.  Come on, Kramer, get out of there.  <moans>  And it was his idea to put a sprig of parsley on the plate.  Wow!   Where did you get all these?  Super bowl! Hey, an original G. I. Joe. With a full frogman                suit.   I'm putting this on him and we're going to the sink.  I just want to touch them a little.  You ran over some pigeons? How many?  Of course. We have a deal. They get out of the way of our                cars, we look the other way on the statue defecation.   So Maranda's cooled on y'a?  Yeah, me neither.  Oh, the sex is wild but she's got this incredible toy collection                and she won't let me near it!  Here comes one.  So he just sidles up?  Maybe you didn't see him.  Hakuna Matata?  That doesn't make it right.  See, to me, the Hakuna Matata is not nearly as embarrassing                as the cup of soup ...  Oh my God!  How did you get this in here?  So where are you gonna sleep?  I'm gonna get that.   So three dates and she still won't let me play with her                toys.  Yeah, that was me.  An Army Pete.  He was made of wood and in the rain he would swell up and                then split.  You, sidle? You ... you stomp around like a Clydesdale!  What happened?  So they're like everyone else.  I'm sorry. You got any booze? Let's say you and I get ripped!  All right. <Jerry checking in the medicine cabinet for                bottles that say "cause drowsiness">  <playing with the toys while Celia is sleeping> Mission                accomplished! Back to base, Joe.  What's he here for?  Well, actually, it's kind of a funny story because she has                this amazing toy collection and last night  Actually she doesn't even know about the toys. I gave her                the wrong kind of medicine and   She's even got that old Matel football game that we love!  Oh, like he's not just carrying you! And has been for years!  So when I saw George on the street with an 18 pound turkey                and a giant box of wine, I thought:   ... I think. Have some more wine.   Oh, George brought home movies of his boyhood trip to Michigan.  More heavy gravy?  Maybe it'll be fun having a pet.  What about my "questionable material"?  Jim Fowler? The animal guy from "Wild Kingdom"                is coming to your apartment?  Tic-Tacs worked?  What? It's a victimless crime.  Okay, one victim.  You know, that batter is, like, 30 years old.  You're like eight years old.  It was great! I've done it a few more time since then.  No, not a thing.   What is this? What is she doing here?  Well, what kind of woman drinks a whole box of wine?  So the whole set was destroyed?  So the squirrel's gonna make it?  Sleeping on the couch? So you're...  ....hair that was on your shower soap today could be in                your head tomorrow. How did they do the first transplant?  Ah..ha!.. really. ( Jerry is barely listening to him )  Oh! well whatever you have to do.  (sarcastically) No you don't..  My show from last night.  Yeah , I was doing new material.  Huh?  The" coup d-toe"  Yeah!  Nothin'.....nothing at all.  Who you calling?  China really?  What for?  Hair?  Done what?  ( to Kramer) What's this?  Doesn't the fat fetish conflict with the minimalism.  Oh! God.. Oh! man.....Oh! brother!!! I can't believe what                I'm hearing. This woman his talking to  I don't know . I have no idea . I was just listening and                she came on.  It was in the back of the room on the left, she must have                been sitting right in front of it.  Good question.  If it was real ,they would never let it out of the country.                No baldness , it'd be like a nation of Supermen.  Tell her. I wanna hear her reaction.  (pushes George) NOT THAT YOU IDIOT!!  The Chinese , the Chinese bald cure.  No I meant the bald cure. We were talking about the bald                cure.  Hey! Is that Peter? ...I can't believe it. Get me a cup                of Decaf.( leaves table)  Remember Peter?  You remember Peter. remember I told you how he went to the                track that one time and he was yelling at this  Oh Elaine....What do you think an enraptured female fan                of mine might say?  She went on in some detail about certain activities, illegal                in some states, for consenting adults.  Well this type of things is very common when you're in show                business.  No I can't she didn't leave her name or number.  Sure.  I don't get it. Why would a woman do that and then leave                no way to get in touch with her.  Why are you doing this?  Elaine have you ever gone out with a bald man?  You know what that makes you?...A baldist.  Well yes I did that's true. A couple of a guys I knew in                the coastguard told me about her.... and I sensed  ( as Ping rambles on ) ...S'cuse me ( Ping looks up) Kind                of an expensive call.  ..She was sitting at the table where I had my tape recorder...Okay                great. Thanks again.. bye.  That's my cockney accent.  Lets hear yours.  That's the worst cockney accent I've ever heard in my life.(                George enters) Hey! Georgie boy , guess what I  Oh! Is that the bald stuff?  Yes I am skeptical.  Make sure you get this area here, where he needs the help....  Happy camper , I don't hear that expression enough.  Yeah.  No kidding?  What happened to the jacket. Did he take it with him?  You can see it. You gonna walk around like that?  How long are you suppose to leave it on for?  Hello.  Well Hello..  Yes , I got her number.  Yeah.  Well , as I said this type of thing is very common in show                business  What? I dunno.  I don't know , Who keeps track of Hellos.  She's coming up.  Yeah. What's wrong, why? ( George runs back to the bathroom)  I would say every two and a half to eight weeks.  The big toe; The captain.  Okay....too bad.  Soon as I get off the phone wih you.  okay , bye ( to George) What happened , did you take it                off?  That's it, you gave up?  That was Elaine , she changed her mind. She's not coming                over.  Hello is this Alicia? .This is Jerry Seinfeld.   This is Jerry Seinfeld.  (to Kramer) ...( words missing)...laugh , everything's nice                and at the end of the night I go for  Yeah..  Come on up . (looks at his watch) ...What's he doing here                now?  She must be psychotic or something.  I'm not giving you her number.  Sheriff?........What's with the hat?  What are doing here now?  What's up?  So just start it.  Oh! Come om . He'll be over there for a half hour, he gets                lost over there.  Kramer, let's do this later.  Kramer. I would like to talk to George for a minute, please.  It's kinda private.  I'M NOT DOING YOUR BITS!!  Does she know?  How did it happen?  Well, why can't you say it?  I thought you just said she doesn't know??  So how can you promise her?  What is this, an Abbott and Costello routine?  What, Elaine?  (picks up the headphones) That was Elaine...  Wait a second. .Just give me a second  She's my ex-girlfriend I think I have precedence  Yeaaaah!!!  Okay, Okay ,I promise. ( puts on the headphones again) Wow!!!                Oh Man...Oh God..  Oooh! I got a pain in my side.  What are you doing here?  Where did you come up with all that stuff?  George NO!!  George I'm telling ya..  Aye......  It's early.  You know, why we're here? [he means: here in the "Comedy                club"] To be out, this is out...and out is one of the single                most enjoyable experiences of life. People...did you ever hear people                talking about "We should go out"? This is what they're                talking about...this whole thing, we're all out now, no one is home.                Not one person here is home, we're all out! There are people tryin'                to find us, they don't know where we are. [imitates one of these                people "tryin' to find us"; pretends his hand is a phone]                "Did you ring?, I can't find him." [imitates other person                on phone] "Where did he go?" [the first person again]                "He didn't tell me where he was going". He must have gone                out. You wanna go out: you get ready, you pick out the clothes,                right? You take the shower, you get all ready, get the cash, get                your friends, the car, the spot, the reservation...There you're                staring around, whatta you do? You go: "We gotta be getting                back". Once you're out, you wanna get back! You wanna go to                sleep, you wanna get up, you wanna go out again tomorrow, right?                Where ever you are in life, it's my feeling, you've gotta go.  Seems to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.                [talking about George's shirt] The second button literally makes                or breaks the shirt, look at it: it's too high! It's in no-man's-land,                you look like you live with your mother.  You do of course try on, when you buy?  Oh, you don't recall?  Well, senator, I just like to know, what you knew and when                you knew it. [a waitress approaches the table]  Can you relax, it's a cup of coffee, Claire is a professional                waitress.  Well, there's this uh, woman might be comin' in.  I told you about Laura, the girl I met in Michigan?  I thought I told you about it, yes, she teaches political                science? I met her the night I did the show in Lansing...[looks                in the milk can] There's no milk in here, what...  Oh, she's really great. I mean, she's got like a real warmth                about her and she's really bright and really pretty and uh...the                conversation though, I mean, it was...talking with her is like talking                with you, but, ya know, obviously much better.  Oh, nothing happened, ya know, but is was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well...not exactly. I mean, she said, you know, she                called this morning and said she had to come in for a seminar and                maybe we'll get together.   Yeah, but...  Yeah!  [indignant] What, are you serious...why, why did she call?  To be polite? You are insane!  Yes!  Oh, I get it, this is about the button.  [to George] Oh, come on now, what are you asking her? Now,                how is she gonna know?  Oh you are beautiful! [ironically]   Good. Did you have fun? You have no idea, what you're talking                about, now, come on, come with me [stands up], I, I gotta go get                my stuff out of the dryer anyway.  Oh, come on, be a "come-with-guy".  Well, look at this guy! Look, he's got everything, he's                got: detergents, sprays, fabric softeners; this is not his first                load.  And you didn't even hear how she sounded.  Laura.  Yeah, but how could you be so sure?  No.  Yeah.  Maybe you're right.  This is insane. You know, I don't even know where she's                staying! She, she's not gonna call me, this is unbelievable.  No no no, don't interrupt the cycle. The machine is working,                it, it knows what it's doing, just let it finish.  You, you can't "overdry".  Same as you can't "overwet". [George looks puzzled]                You see, once something is wet, it's wet. Same thing with dead:                like once you die you're dead, right? Let's say you drop dead and                I shoot you: you're not gonna die again, you're already dead. You                can't "overdie", you can't "overdry".  How could she not tell me where she was staying? [George                stands by the dryer again and secretly opens it: the dryer stops                working and George closes the lid]  "Laundry-day" is the only exciting day in the                live of clothes. It is...no, think about it: the washing machine                is the nightclub of clothes. Ya know, it's dark, there's bubbles                happening, they're all kind a dancing around in there...shirt grabs                the underwear: "C'mon babe, let's gather". You come by,    [The phone rings. He picks it up and says:] If you know                what happened in the Mets-game, don't say anything, I taped it,                hello... Yeah, no, I'm sorry, you have the wrong number...Yeah,                no [somebody knocks at the door] Yeah? [to the door, while still                at the phone]  [To Kramer] Yeah...[in the phone] Yeah, people do move!                Have you ever seen the big trucks out on the street? Yeah, no problem                [hangs up the phone].  [upset] Ooohhhh, what are you doing? Kramer, it's a tape!                [actually I can't understand the name; maybe "Kramer"                wasn't named "Kramer" in the pilot!] I taped the game,                it's one o'clock in the morning! I avoided human contact all night                to watch this.  [a little irritated] Meat? I don't, I don't know, go...hunt!                [Kramer walks to the refrigerator and sticks his head in] Well what,                what happened in the game anyway?  [cynical] Yeah you almost went to the game. You haven't                been out of the building in ten years!  No.  Yeah, yeah...you can have it tomorrow.  No, it's OK now, that, that girl is not comin' uh, I, I                misread the whole thing.  I don't think so.  That close, huh?  Hello...Oh, hi, Laura.  [gestures Kramer to shut up] No believe me, I'm always up                at this hour. How are you?...great...sure...What time does the plane                get in?...I got my friend George to take me...[Kramer suddenly notices                something in the Mets-game on TV]...  ...No, it's, it's just my neighbour...uhm...yeah, I got                it [takes a pencil and a cereal box to write on] ten-fifteen...No,                don't be silly, go ahead and ask...Yeah, sure...OK, great, no no,                it's no trouble at all...I'll see you tomorrow...great, bye. [hangs                up the phone; to Kramer:] I, I don't believe it...That, that was                her. She wants to stay here!  If my father was moving this he'd had to have a cigarette                in his mouth the whole way. [talks from now on like he has a cigarette                in his mouth] Have you got your end?...Your end's got to come down                first, easy now, drop it down...drop it down, your end's got to                come down.  [hands George a beer] Look, it's a very awkward situation,                I, I don't wanna be presumptuous.  All right, she said she couldn't find a decent hotel- room...  Yeah, a decent hotel-room, would it be terribly inconvenient                if she stayed at my place.  [cynical] This is the signal. Thank you, mister Signal,                where were you yesterday?  Yeah.  This is a person I like, it's not: "How to score on                spring break".  Yeah, OK. Oh, wait a second. Oh, I, I forgot to clean the                bathroom.  Now, how could that be good?  This is how you operate?  Let me just wipe the sink.  The dating world is not a fun world...it's a pressure world,                it's a world of tension, it's a world of pain...and ya know, if                a woman comes over to my house, I gotta get that bathroom ready,                'cause she needs things. Women need equipment. I don't know what                they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they                need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one                I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no                cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never                had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been                in a situation, when I thought to myself: "I could use a cotton-ball                right now"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need                them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them,                they need bags, they're like peat-moss(?) bags, have you ever seen                these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out,                they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls,                ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em                is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree,                that look like they've been through some horrible experience...                tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once                went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls                over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out,                I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought                maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town:                "Let's move on"... The dating world is a world of pressure.                Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night.                The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many                job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end                of it...ya know: "Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man                for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the                people you'll be workin' with?".  Wouldn't it be great if you could ask a woman what she's                thinking?  Ya know, instead, I'm like a detective: I've gotta pick                up clues, the whole thing is a murder investigation.  Really? How?  Uh-huh.  Right.  "Lip-area".  Hug is definitely good.  Although what if it's one of those hugs where the shoulders                are touching, the hips are eight feet apart?  Ya know how they do that?  Shake is bad, but what if it's the "two-hander"?    Right.  Hey, hey.  It's good to see you.  This is my friend George.  This is Laura.  [to Laura] I can't believe you're here.  [privately to George] Now that was an interesting greeting,                did you notice that, George?  So uh, what do ya think?  Yeah, it kind a motivates me to work on the road...So uh,                make yourself at home. [Laura sits down on the couch, takes off                her shoes and opens some buttons of her shirt] So uh, can I get                you anything? Uuhhh, bread, water...salad-dressing?  Uh, no, yeah, go right ahead. [she turns down the lamp]  Uh, yeah, yeah, sure, why don't you stay? Yeah, uhm...What                is your, what is your schedule for tomorrow? Are you, are you doin'                anything?  Really? What would you like to do?  [doubtfully] Yeah, we could do that...why not, why not.                [pours the wine] I'm just, I'm really glad you're here. [the phone                rings; he picks it up] Yeah, hello...yes...yes, she is, hold on.                [to Laura] Uhm, it's for you.  You're engaged?  You're engaged? [still can't believe it]  You're engaged! [like he's answering his own question]  Yeah.  Me too!  I swear, I have absolutely no idea what women are thinking.                I don't get it, OK? I, I, I admit, I, I'm not getting the signals.                I am not getting it! Women, they're so subtle, their little...everything                they do is subtle...men are not subtle, we are obvious. Women know                what men want, men know what men want, what do we want? We want                women, that's it!...It's the only thing we know for sure, it really                is: we want women. How do we get them? Oh, we don't know 'bout that,                we don't know. The next step after that we have no idea. This is                why you see men honking car-horns, yelling from construction sites.                These are the best ideas we've had so far...The car-horn-honk, is                that a beauty? Have you seen men doing this? What is this? The man                is in the car, the woman walks by the front of the car, he honks:                [imitates horn]  No, you didn't.  No she didn't.  You walk around with no underwear?  I do a wash.  When you were with her you said you couldn't stand her.  You said goin up the steps of her apartment was like being              taken to a cell.  George, I don't know if that is such a good idea?  You need some professional advice. Why don't you go see              Elaine's friend? She's a therapist.   No, no no [Elaine enters, flossing teeth] Elaine what's                the name of that friend of yours ... that's a therapist ... the              woman.  Right, Dana Folley.  She's the model I met on the plane.  Um uh. And we're going out Saturday night.  What are you doing?  The religious guy?  Let us pray.  Yeah.  Kramer, should I call Susan?  Yeah, he's good. He takes good pictures. He's got equipment              over there.  George I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave.              So, I'm thinking of putting in na tropical fish tank right              here.  Well, I figure if it doesn't work out I can always flush              them down the toilet.  What's that perfume you're wearing?  What is that smell?  It smells like the beach.  Oh my God is that the new perfume?   I can't believe this. My next door neighbour had the idea                for this exact perfume last year. He even met with an executive              at CALVIN KLEIN. I can't believe they stole his idea.  And you're the model for this perfume?  Uh, that's him. He just came home. ... Uh, the door [Jerry              pushes his door against Kramer's entrance]  Hey.  Yeah, uh, I'll see you later.   All right come on in. ... Just wait over HERE! Just wait              here and I'll get it for you. ... Kramer this is Tia.  NO! Kramer!  Oh, you're tall - she's tall I'm tall. What's the difference              who's tall. We're all tall.  What?  [starting the Dust Buster] What smell?  Oh, they're all the same. Here. [gives him Dust Buster]              Now if you'll excuse us, ..  Okay.  I'll see you later.  Ooow, that was close.  I know look at this [shows ad]  Oh, volunteer work!. See that's what I like about the holiday                season. That's the true spirit of Christmas. People being helped                by people other than me. That makes me feel good inside. Look at                what we have here. [mail]. A Christmas card from Laine. You didn't              have to go to all that trouble.  I didn't even see the picture. How did it come out?  Oh yeah. Look at that. Looks good. Kramer did a good job.  ... um ...  Did you look at look at this picture carefully?  Because I'm not sure and and and correct me if I'm wrong              but I think I see ... a nipple.  Here. Take a look. What, what is that?  That's what I thought.  DIDN'T YOU LOOK AT THE PICTURE?  Well, maybe no one noticed it. You didn't notice it. Let              me go get Newman. We'll see if he sees it.  Oh what's the difference. Everybody else you know has it.              Take a look at this card. Tell me if you notice anything              unusual about it.  Okay. Thanks.  No.   What? So what? It's a nipple. A little round circular protuberance.              What's the big deal? See everybody's got them. See I got them.   Everybody's got them.   No, No, No, No, Oh, No.  Well every day for the past four days she hasn't returned              one call.   It was a scratch.   Don't you think I know the difference between a pick and              a scratch?   Yeah?  Come on up.   There may have been some incidental penetration. But from              her angle she was in no position to make the call.   Is that so unforgivable? Is that like breaking a commandment?              Did God say to Moses thou shalt not pick?   Let me ask you something. If you were going out with somebody                and if she did that what would, would you do? Would you continue              going out with her?  yeah. I think I do.   I can't She won't return my calls because she caught me              in a pick at a light.  But that's not what she thinks.   All right. I'll call the agency. [Elaine grabs card from                George] Hello. Yes, I'm trying to get in touch with Tia Van Camp.                Do you know if she's been in town? She's been in town. Oh really.                well thank you very much. [hangs up] She has been in town. She's              at CALVIN KLEIN's right now.  Hello there you are.  Well, I had to talk to you - I noticed you haven't been              returning my calls.  Because I - I thought we had a good time the other night,                an' the only explanation I can come up with is that you think that              you caught me (flustered, he  But I was clearly on the outer edge of the nostril.  But there - but there was no pick! I - I did not pick! There              ws no piick!  No! No pick!  An' what if I did do it? Even though I admit to nothing,                and never will. What does that make me? And I'm not here just defending              myself but all those  The pick?  I think I've seen that look.   Boy, they really worked on your pectorals.   What is so bad about having a little piece of cake?  Why aren't you there now?  You know, I shouldn't go out with a friend of yours. I foresee                messiness.  Hey, speaking of tomato sauce, you want to come with me                and George to Mario's Pizza?  They're closing. We're going for one last slice.  Where did you get this?  You sure have a lot of friends. How come I never see any                of these people?  So they just gave you this?  How come I haven't read about this?  Son of dad?  We used to come in every day.  All right, make it the large sodas.  Yeah. And then you went on to...Well, it's a good game.  Hey, look at the high score--"G.L.C." George Louis                Costanza. That's not you, is it?  I remember that night.  I think I remember why we stopped coming here.  I'll tell you Lisi, I never expected that movie to--  Be that long. I mean, most action movies are--  Not as long.  Get going.  Well, it was nice meeting you. I'm sure I'll see you--  Actually, that's--  Right.  Sure. (points at booth) How about this one?  Fabulous. See, now you're really do something.  Hey, how you gonna keep the machine plugged in while you                move it?  Once you unplug the machine, all the scores will be erased.  Another friend?  Come on.  Hello?  She's a sentence finisher. It's like dating Mad Libs.  What is that?  So join in.  All right.  Hey, wh-what--  Well Lisi, that was another-  Really bad meal. I was thinking maybe we should--  Call it a night. I'll walk you home. Where do you live?  Riverside Park.  Back to my place. That's right.  She lives right off Riverside Park. I was scared of the                Lopper, So I let her stay over.  Well, I just wanted to make out a little, but she kind of--  How'd it taste?  Yeah.  Pennsylvania Dutch country? Oh, that's the serious relationship                weekend place.  Well, I think by sleeping with her, I may have sent her                the wrong message.  Well, I'm calling this off right now.   Well, I'm not going over there. That's where the Lopper                is.  Hi, Lisi.  Uh, yeah. I found it on the street. It's gotta be worth                something.  Well, before we do anything...maybe we should talk.  Then this Pennsylvania Dutch thing comes out of nowhere.                I mean, how am I supposed to respond to that?  Well I'm sorry if I ruined your life. That's exactly what                I set out to do.  Have we even been in public?  You are not dumb. Don't say that..  These beans are pretty good.  Well, I'm sorry I'm not Brad. I'm me!  Nice to meet ya!  Oh, thank god. Why is it dark out? What time is it?  We've been breaking up for 10 hours?  Lopper. You know, Lisi, maybe we should give this a little                more time. See how it looks in the light of day.  Lopper.  Lisi, Lisi. Let me in! We can work this out. I was wrong,                you were right. I'll do anything!  No. I'm waiting for...  Oh. Sounds great.  Oh, I can't. I'm busy. I'm going away on a long weekend.  Great. Uh, you know what? Why don't you put it in the car                so I don't toss it in that dumpster?  A long, long weekend.  Well, come on George, I'll help you push it across.  By yourself?  Game over.  George and I went up to NBC and we told them our idea for a series          now we're just waiting to sign the contract.  Yeah.  What writer? It's a sitcom.   Soon, there's a couple of problems.  What do you expect? It's airline food.   How could you eat fish on a plane?  Well, George doesn't think $13,000 is enough money.  We're going to sign it. We're going to sign it. In fact George          is out with the woman from NBC right now.   I don't even know?  Oh uh   That's enough with this piece of junk I've had it. (throws watch          in garbage)  Yeah, but it never worked.  . . . it's being fixed.   It's at the jeweler.  I'm not sending you the bill.   What are you talking about? It's my car. You can pay for the gas.  Dad!  I have money. I make money.  You don't think I make money. That's what you think isn't it?  Yes you do. That's what you both think.   I'm paying.   You're not paying   You're not doing this.   Boy, you got a lot of stuff here. . . . Dad, what are you doing?  Leave it. What about your back?   You come all the way up here to see a back specialist and you're          lifting heavy suit cases.  Why did you tell this crazy guy that Kramer didn't invite him          to his party?   I didn't know he wasn't invited  It was a mistake.  He's got like a chemical imbalance. He needs to be on medication.  Kramer!!  He's joking.  Nooo.  He's not after me.   Who are you going to call?  I didn't do anything.  No, he just doesn't like me.  You know, it seems impossible.  Ma, I know this may be hard for you to understand but I am sure          there are many people who do not like me.  It's true.  Um, huh, I don't have my watch on. It's being fixed.  Uh, next week.  Huh?  I don't know. They're backed up.  Where'd I take it?  Where did I take it? Where Did I Take It? (stabbing with knife)          Um, to that place on, uh Columbus and uh, 85  Yeah.  No, Kramer, I don't want you to say anything to him  He's a friend of mine.  I'd like to follow the regular procedures. I don't want any special          treatment.  Be right back. (follows Kramer out)  . . . I threw it in the garbage can on the street. It didn't keep          good time. My parents gave it to me so don't mention it again, okay!   All right.  You what? You passed? How could you do that?  Let me explain to you what you just did. There are literally hundreds          of people trying to get pilot deals with them this year. They go with          maybe, five. Okay, if we pass, they go to the next show.   We're lucky they are even interested in the idea in the first          place. We got a show about nothing. With no story. What do you think,          they're up there going, maybe we should give those two guys, who have          no experience and no idea, more money!   Well, I think you're wrong.  Yes we will.   I just said that.  So good for you.  We'll you're repeating everything I'm saying?  Well George is an idiot.  No I don't want them.  Yes?  Federal Express? Come on up. . . . Federal Express. I'm not expecting          a package.   You think so?  So you want us to abolish all home package deliveries.  Who is it?  I missed you.  Oh, it's my parents. My father came up to see a back specialist.          Yeah.  So tell us about the trip. How's Dr. Reston?  Things are good?  Uh oh.   Did you see that?  It's a tell. You gotta tell.  When you ask someone about their relationship and they touch their          face you know it's not going too well. Go ahead ask me how it's going          with somebody.  Good, going good (scratches chin) And the higher up on the face          you go the worse the relationship is getting. You know it is like - pretty          good - not bad - I gotta get out.  What are you eating my peanut butter out of the jar with your          disgusting index fingers? This is a sickening display.  You're off bread. . . . So what happened is it over?  Why not?  Svenjolly.  George?  So maybe he's got like a cheerful mental hold on you.  Nice try.  So you didn't even let the doctor treat you?  Hi Uncle Leo.  Hey, where's the waiter. Dad, what say we have some red meat tonight.          Let's live a . .    Can we continue this another time.  I hear you're going out with David Putty.  Well, I think he could've asked me. Supposed to be a friend                of mine.  Elaine, you always care who an ex-girlfriend dates. You                don't want  The former still applies. I don't know what it is, but I                just can't  All right.  Hi.  Yeah, so.  What move?  Wait a second. *My* move?  David Putty used *my* move?  Are you sure?  I can't believe it.

He stole my move!  Yeah, but it's like another comedian stealing my material.  Oh, yeah. The pinch. *I've* done the pinch. That's not new.  I know, he's probably the only honest mechanic in New York.  ...so he stole my move and he's using it on Elaine.  Can I just get it opened first?  All right, all right. Here. [hands George a piece of the                candy  You feel better?  Nancy Klopper?  All right, George. I'm gonna tell you. But I just wanna                make sure,  It's not even a question of that. The point is when something                like  All right. On your bed. You got a headboard? You'll need                a  Is it padded?  Good. How tall is she?  You can't have more than a one-foot differential in your                heights.  George, if you could master this, you'll never be alone                again.  Now, the ending is kind of an option. I use the swirl. I                like the  I prefer clockwise, but it's not written in stone.  What is it?  When did you do this?  Oh... Why Fusilli?  Well, thank you very much.  Assman?  Who would order a license plate that says "Assman"?  It doesn't have to be someone who gets a lot of women. It                could be  Yeah. Proctologist.  I'll tell you where I'd like to stick it.  Hey, David.  Hey, what's the story? I hear you're doing my move.  What move? *My* move. The one I told you about. You used                it on  The ending is the whole thing. Without the ending, it's                nothing.  Swirl.  Oh, yeah, I know. You do the *pinch*.  You can't come up with your own stuff , so you *steal* other                peoples?  Well, I'll tell you what I'll do, you know. If you wanna                do it out  Fine.  You must have done *something* wrong. You probably screwed                up the  Oh my god. Yes, you close with the swirl. There's a progression  Yeah?  C'mon up. [turns to George] You know what? Do me a favor.                Don't  Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What?

What is it?  Huh.  Listen. I need you to do me a favor. When's the next time                you're  You gotta get an estimate on my car from him. I think this                garage is  Well, look. Here's the work order with everything that broke.                Just  That's, uh, Fusilli Jerry.  Yeah. Kramer made it.  Hey, Assman!  Hi.  Sixteen hundred dollars? That's all? *Ooh*, they are ripping                me  Well, that's it. I'm going back to Putty. No move is worth                this.  Are you kidding? He can do every move I've ever done! Do                you know  Hi, Mr. Constanza. What's uh...?  I don't know. Why?  What do you mean?  Really, stopping short. That's a good move.  Hey.  Oh, my god!  If I wasn't there, I wouldn't have believed it.  He had to use cork-screw pasta.  Assman!  how come you didn't say hello to me the other day, huh?!  Really? What happened?  Isn't he the one with the show on cable?  That's great.   That looks pretty good.  Is that so?  Hey, Kramer if I killed somebody would you turn me in?  You're kidding?  You would turn me in?  I can't believe your a friend of mine.  Well, I am sure I had a good reason.  But you know me!  So you're nothing but a stoolie. Admit it.  Another Caf Latte?  Hey, baby. I set the trends. Who do you think started this whole          Caf Latte?  I don't recall you drinking Caf Latte.  Hey, Planet 9 From Outer Space is playing tomorrow night. One          show only.  You know I was supposed to see this five years ago. I was in a          Chinese restaurant with George and Elaine and got all screwed up trying          to get a table and I missed it.  Look at this Jerry, dropping paper on the ground. That's littering.          Maybe you better call the cops and turn me in.  Let me take a guess. She cried and you caved.  I live and breathe my friend. . . . I live and breathe.  tes, it's very difficult. Few men have the constitution for it.          That's why breakups take two or three tries. You gotta build up your immunity.          Well, at least you probably had some, uh, pretty good make-up          sex after.  You didn't have make-up sex? How could you not have make-up sex?          I mean that's the best feature of the heavy relationship.  In your situation the only sex you're going to have better than          make-up sex is if you're dent to prison and you have a conjugal visit.  . . . Poor bastard.  Good evening, Rabbi.  Well, Rabbi, well.  Yeah, that's right.  What do you mean?  No.  is that so?   Really?  I didn't know any of this.  Hum, well it all comes as news to me.   You iknow I talked to the rabbi outside.  Understand you had a little talk with him too.  Yes I know, I know.   Nothing, nothing.   Yes he did.  We had quite a little chat.  Yes, about how you're very jealous of George. How you wished it          was you who were getting married instead of him.   It didn't take much prodding either, I must say.  He did it.  That's what's so fascinating.   You better finish your little caf latte there. They won't let          you in with it.  Because they don't allow outside drinks into the movie.  That's the rule.  Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me  Elaine, if I could say a word here about Jewish people. That man          in no way represents our ability to take in a nice piece of juicy gossip          and keep it to ourselves.  No, . . . about how you wish it was YOU who was getting married          instead of him? Feelings of resentment, hostility?  I love it when you get your car back from the car place, and   He pulled an LBJ on you.  Lyndon Johnson, used to do that to his staffers.  Oh yeah. He'd hold national security meetings in there. He   Ask him to repeat it. Tell him there was an echo in there.  You know what you do? Ask him a follow-up question. Tell him   Hey.  Can I have my keys...  (catching keys) ...back, please?  Well, what d'you think the hoboes are doing?  No I can't. I gotta pick up Elaine. I'm taking her to this   (re-entering) Hey, you're not talking that Michigan deposit   (leaving) You two keep an eye on each other?  Are you sure you didn't hear my car making a funny noise? I know          Sue Ellen Mishke, the braless 'O Henry' candy bar heiress.  Hi Sue Ellen.  I'm here to catch a glimpse... of high society.  Think she wants those clubs.  Well, that's your ceiling.  I really thought you had her there at seventeen thousand.  Do you hear this clunking?  Okay.  Bye.  What's going on here?  Oh God!  (angry) Oh, you idiots!  Hey. You put your groceries under the hood of my car?  And your crab legs, and a thing of cheese. The Triple-A guy said          Now I gotta take the car down to Tony and get it checked out.  Yeah, he's real good. But he's so obsessive about the car. He          No, thank you.  Yeah. So, anyway, the engine's been idling a little rough. I   There's really nothing wrong on the inside.  No, I hadn't noticed.  Have I been picking at it? No. You know. It's just wear and   The engine is really the only thing that needs checking.  Try to.  The song Downtown? You mean the Petula Clark song?  You sure he didn't just mention it because you happened to be          Okay, so how does it go?  '... downtown.'  '...downtown.'  Seven-eleven?  No, that's midtown.  '...down town.'  '...downtown.'  Well, 'don't hang around and let your troubles surround you.   How can you lose?  Hello.  Oh, hi.  Oh, you know what?  Oh, no. It's no big deal. I left the clubs in the car.  I forgot.  I can't. The car's at the mechanics.  No, no, you can't. He's working on the car right now. You can          Hey, Tony.  Sure.  Well, I change it so often, I mean to come all the way down   I really wanna...  How much money is this gonna cost me?  The washer fluid is fine.  Alright, you know what, uhm... I just wanna take my car, and I'm          Just, can I have my car? I wanna pay my bill, I'm gonna be on          my   Well, just get it down.  Okay. Thank you, very much.  He's bringing it.  These are the receipts from 85 and I'm going to do 86.  I don't blame you. I blame myself.   OK, I blame you.   What was I supposed to do? You knew I was on my first date                with Elaine. You come   I find the whole thing very embarrassing.  Yeah, tha's easy when you have no income.  Hi  Kramer dating your room mate. It's funny.   Oh he's uh, helping me sort my receipts. I'm being audited.                Oh, I contributed money to a charity that turned out to                be fraudulent. It's very   Uh, Along long time ago, in a galaxy far far away.   Volcano? Really?   Something to drink?   You got it ALL wrong. I was thinking only of the poor Krakatoans                Those brave Krakatoans East of Java. who sacrifice so much                for so long.  No, that's Krama.  It's all taken care of.  An old friend of mine, whom you may have met, George Costanza,                I don't know. It must be love.  ... if this audit had happened to me and I didn't have this                woman to help  Have you ever been through an audit?  It's hell. It's the financial equivalent of a complete rectal  Yeah  Come up - Ah, there he is, the man himself, George Louis                Costanza. Here I am about to go   And there's so much more to go.  So what happened? You gave her my tax papers? ... My papers?                What happened you didn't give her the papers?   SO?   You what?   I'm being audited! And you broke up with her?  Why will she still do it? She hates you now. People don't                do you favors after you dump   How is that possible?   Oh, my God.   It's unheard of ...  So you lie! What did you tell her?   Pretentious!? The woman has my tax papers. You told her                she was  OK, wait a second, wait a second, what happened to my papers?                Yeah, I know champagne, limos, cigars. WHAT happened to                the papers?   Is that relevant? She TOOK them. Call her office.  What? What?   This is no good. This is no good. Call her house.   Not good.  Not good   I can see that. What's it for?  Yeah (to buzzer)  Come on up.  wouldn't it be invisible? I mean, what, are you going to                just sense it's  What's with you two?  Tell me what?  Completely naked?   OK, just a second lets not lose our heads here. Kramer you                know you are always welcome in my   You'll sense it.  Well, what happened? Was she there?   You didn't get my papers?  Well, where is she?  A mental institution?  You know I hate to raise a crass financial concern but was                there any  So what now?   Can we go out there?   Woodhaven.  My cousin Douglas was in a place like this one time . He                came over to  That'd be great. There's no wrong answer.   Tuberculosis  Leroy  Tuberculosis  Want, want? What could I possibly want? Uh, I just came                because I, I heard so many nice things   Just chatting. Friendly.   It's one stupid thing after another. So let me ask you,                when you come to one of these places,   He's never guiled. You know some women keep a lot of important                papers in their, uh, pocket book.   there are no copies.  Who makes copies?   <on phone>Yes, I'm trying to get a copy of a receipt                for a computer thatI bought there....   Anybody want to take a walk down to 48th street? I think                I may have tracked down another receipt.   George?   You're going by 48th St. You can give me a ride.  Why not?  What about over there? You know air conditioners fall out                all the time.  No, cab's comin' in right here (Hand at waist) Set of plastic                hips,  You were livin' in the village then, right?  That is disgusting.  Well, then you're drivin' me wild.  (George enters) Oh, why you havin' a party?  Like with dogs.  He's gonna show up anyway.  Isn't that what Jack Ruby said?  Who wants two? Special sneak preview of Death Blow.  Kramer, do you know what I had to go through to get these?  Yeah I guess I do owe you.  No, I'm okay.  I'm fine. (George enters, Kramer exits) How was the party?  So I didn't miss anything?  Elaine danced?  Did she do the little kicks and the thumbs?  For some time. It was about five years ago. I never knew                what to say to her  And by then you've lost interest.  What made him get that thing?  Not a very long trip. (Enter Kramer)  I don't even have the extra ticket yet.  How could that be?  No, George was there, he said he had a great time.  Oh, what are you talkin' about?  Now you're talkin' crazy!  (Makes sound) Oh there's my call waiting, I gotta get goin'.  Really? I thought you were rebuffed.  Maybe Elaine put in a good word for you.  Interesting. She doesn't care for you, then a stern warning,                suddenly a  You've been the bad employee, the bad son, the bad friend...  The bad fianc, the bad dinner guest, the bad credit                risk...  The bad date, the bad sport, the bad citizen... (looks at                table as George  Half of show business is here.  That's quite a feed bag you're workin' on there.  I'm a joke maker.  (To Kramer) Hey, hey, what the hell is he doing?  Does what?  May I see you outside for a moment please?  Outside!  What do you mean he's bootlegging the movie?  It's not legitimate.  Where did you meet this guy?  Kramer. (boom sound)  I don't believe this. (They run into theater)  Hey, what is going on over there?  Are you nuts? There's no way I'm holding that thing.  Yeah well, maybe if he didn't lick his fingers before he                reached in the bag we would've eaten some. Serves him right.  All right, I'm takin' the camera.  Oh man...  How was the rest of Death Blow?  Kramer, you make me get a ticket for this friend of yours                and then the guy forces me to bootleg the movie at gun point!  You know, he came by here at 3 o'clock in the morning to                pick up the tape. I was scared out of my mind!  What are you, crazy? I don't want to see this guy again.  What if I didn't do it right?  People with guns don't understand. That's why they get guns.                Too many  Hi.  Yeah.  Well, I did the best I could.  I don't want another gig! I'm not doin' this.  We're talkin' federal crime here.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no! What were you thinking when                you shot this?  Do you even know what this scene is about?  No, bread is his soul. He's trying to buy back a loaf of                his soul.  Kramer there is no way you're giving this tape to Brody                and telling him I shot it.  I don't care about Brody. I was up on 96th Street today,                there was a kid couldn't have been more than ten years old. He was                asking a street vendor if he had any other bootlegs as good as Death                Blow. That's who I care about. The little kid who needs bootlegs,                because his parent or guardian won't let him see the excessive violence                and strong sexual content you and I take for granted.  I have to. But I'm gonna need to storyboard this whole thing.                Where are my magic markers?  I forgot to make my bed. (He tries to get away)  All right, you're beyond stink.  And that's not helpin' either. That's why you're havin'                trouble with your staff, not because of George.  Have you ever seen yourself? (She starts dancing) Ah, ah,                please, please. Not in my home. I gotta go throw this stuff in the                laundry. I'll be right back.  No, I didn't shoot this one. I'm just scouting the location.  You'll get your tape. But here's what I'm gonna need. I'm                gonna need three cameras, two on the floor, one in the balcony.                And I want headsets for the guys runnin' 'em. I wanna be able to                talk to 'em.  Kramer...  All right. That's it, I can't work like this.  I'm off the project. (He exits)  They think they can get anyone to shoot these bootlegs.  Eh, the whole business has changed. It's all about money                now. The sad thing  Kramer, I'm not doin' this anymore. I don't know what I                was thinking. It's illegal, it's dangerous...  What?  Oh now I see. (Buzzer) Yeah.  What're we gonna do?  I think that's it. (They play it and see Elaine dancing)                Sweet fancy Moses!  Uh, well. It, uh...  Yeah, out of nowhere there's this lone dancer who appears                to be injured.  Yeah, so you cry... and when you see the dancer, you cry                again.  But he's an old man, Elaine.  (Seeing a street vendor) Hey, it's the bootlegged Death                Blow that I shot.  No you don't.  Yeah.  Thank you. (They continue walking)  I'm still big. It's the bootlegs that got small. So how                are things at the  I wouldn't worry about it. (People on sidewalk behind them                are doing her dance as they go)  [To himself] Now what am I supposed to do here? Shall I go over          there? It's not like somebody died. It's "Beaches" for god's          sake. If she was sitting next to me I'd put my arm around her. I can't          be making a big move like going all the way over there. I can't. I won't.          She calls me this morning and tells me she's upset I didn't console          her. I mean it was "Beaches" for god's sake. What, what do you          do in a situation like that?   I was sitting on the chair. She was over here on the couch.   Of course.  yeah,   The Improv is playing "Rochelle Rochelle" The musical.  She might be. She's the star of the show.   Yeah, maybe.  That's the understudy. I'm dating her.  Yeah.  I'm glad she's an understudy. I don't have to avoid going back          stage and having to think of something to say.  Just once I would like to tell someone they stink. You know what?          I doidn't like the show. I didn't like you. It just really stunk. The          whole thingreal bad. Stinkaroo. Thanks for the tickets though.   How would you know? You don't speak Korean.  Why don't you go to another nail shop?  What you need is a translator to go in the shop with you and tell          you what they're saying.  You know who speaks Korean?  George's father.  He used to go there a lot on business.  He sold religious articles the statues of Jesus, the virgin Mary,          that were manufactured in Korea.  George, does your father speak Korean?  Oh, hi Gennice.  This is George, this is Kramer.  Playing today?  They really stick to that understudy rule.  It's okayit's just a hot dog, (still sobbing) everything          is going to be okay.  Come on George, just loosen up.  Come on George.  [to George] Keep going.  Well we  [with no emotion] It's okay. Everything is going to be all right.          Come back another time.  I don't know why I have to go to the hospital. I didn't do anything          to Bette Midler. Driver can you stop over here, we're picking somebody          up.   Hey, I'm being heckled on stage. People are yelling out Galloogy.          Stop your crying will ya?  Hey, I had nothing to do with it.  We just want to talk to her. We want to apologize and tell her          the whole thing was an accident.   What?  What happened?  Oh,, that's nice. Alright, I'll see you later.  Where?   [pushing her] How did you get that?  You met J. Peterman?  What is he like?  (walking away) Yeah, I'll see ya'.  Well, break a leg tonight.  Listen buddy,  Oh, I'm so sorry.  So you don't cry when your grandmother dies? But a hotdog makes          you lose control?  Good luck.  Yeah.  That's alright, I got it.  Elaine, stop it.  I'm sorry.  Oh, she worked at Doubleday...?  Right, just like you.   Ah. I'm watching my height. My doctor doesn't want me to get any          taller. So you're Miss, uh...  I was almost Mr. Coffee. They felt I was a little too relaxed.          <Miss Rhode Island laughs.>  Tonight. I have to call her, she's staying in a hotel.  And get this - I'm working in Atlantic City this weekend, and          she's going to be down there for the pageant.  The only bad thing is, we have to go out with a chaperone.  No, it's part of the contest rules.  I don't know, she just sits there.  I'm not sure if she's allowed to talk. <Picks up the phone          and dials.>  Yeah. (sings) There she is...Miss - yes, room 417 please? Karen          Hanson?  Of course, they're polyester.  Why   You're going to do something about it?  Hello, Karen? It's Jerry Seinfeld. Oh, that's very sweet of you.          You know, you better be careful, you don't want to get too congenial.          They'll slap that "Miss Congeniality" on you, and you'll congene          yourself right out of the contest. So, what time do you want to get together          later? What? So what, we don't need the chaperone. (To George) The chaperone          can't make it. (To Karen) Oh, you're not gonna get disqualified! So, we're          not going? <Kramer enters.> Hold on one second. (To Kramer) Hey,          what are you doing tonight?  I'm going out with one of the Miss America contestants, you wanna          go?  Rhode Island.  Look, do you want to go or not? I'll buy you dinner.  Congratulations!  Now, what is it that you do, exactly?  Like what?  Really! Socks!  Hey, maybe you can pick me up some underwear! <Kramer enters.>  Listen...tonight, after we finish eating, you make like you got          something else to do and just "recede into the night," if you          know what I mean.  What?  I'm not going to "defile" her!  But -   But wait a minute...  That's a hell of a plan. (To Kramer) Listen -   Alright, Kramer!  Hey, come on!  I'll be right back. <Leaves the table.>  Well, here we are...  Well, if it isn't Mr. Blackwell.  And that waist cincher, that was the topper!  Yes, I poo-poo.  I don't want to stop her!  Yeah, so do you. <George enters with a newspaper.>  See what?  Boy, they really do sound comfortable.  I'm working in Atlantic City.  Yeah. Hey, you're not working this weekend, why don't you come          down?  You know what, maybe Elaine wants to go too, lemme call her. <Picks          up the phone.> She's at Mr. Pitt's, I think I got the number...  Hi, Mr. Pitt! Is Elaine there?  Hey Elaine, it's me.  We're going to Atlantic City.  Today, right now! Are you in?  Why not?  Hey.  Good. How was the roulette?  Yeah, all she had to do was buy Mr. Pitt a pair of socks!  What the hell is that?  Wait a second. <Grabs the icebucket off the counter.> This'll          scare 'em off. <Dumps the bucket of water over the balcony. We hear          a loud squawking noise and the flapping of wings, then the noise is gone.          Jerry gets back into bed.> Well, good night, Ollie.  What? Why? What happened?  Birds?  What are you looking at? <Kramer goes out onto the terrace          and looks down.> Oh, that! We had to leave that outside, last night,          because the water was making the room too cold.  No, you don't understand - it's not what you think! It was an          accident!  Kramer, you gotta explain to her what happened...! <Kramer          exits.>  Oh, it was just Kramer...apparently I killed Miss Rhode Island's          doves with a bucket of water last night.  I heard those doves were really incredible.   It's like watching an animal get tortured.  Oh, great! Alright. <We hear the announcers calling the game.>  That's a shame.  The remote, the remote, I can't find the remote. Did I lost, I          lost it. Did you take it? Did you put it some place?  All right, what is this?  All right, very funny. I get it.  Come on. Go back to your apartment and fix it.  Your pants!  Don't you know? Look-look at your face! You only shaved the right          side of your face! What is this? A joke?  Go look at your face in the mirror.  Come on up.  You mean, you didn't know you were doing any of these things?  I bet this is from that kick from that crazy Joe Davola. You better          see a doctor and get some X-rays.  From that woman at NBC?  All right, well, we should all chip in I guess.  How much was it to clean the vest?  Can you get vomit out of suede?  What? Yo-yo Ma?  You just said 'Yo-yo Ma'.  He's a cellist. (to Kramer) You should see a doctor today.  I can't believe she sent you that dry-cleaning bill.  That doesn't really bode well for the show, does it?  Oh, yeah. Right. Like anybody's ever gonna do this! How did you          get me to go along with that? A show about nothing!  NBC! They wanna have another meeting about the idea.  I don't know about sixty.  Ted Danson! Now, how are you comparing us to Ted Danson?  Yes, you did. You said 'We're Ted Danson'!  You know, I think he wears a piece.  I'm ten minutes slow again! That's it for this piece of junk!          I've had it.   Yeah! But it never works. You know we're supposed to be there          by two o'clock. We should take a cab.  I'll pay for it.  Well, what is it you object to? The comfort? The Speed? The convenience?  Uncle Leo!  Hello there, how're you doing?  Good, good.  Good, fine.  Oh, no. I've been kinda busy. It's all.  Oh, yeah, yeah. I remember.  We, we got a big meeting with the president of NBC.  I'm sorry, really.  Sorry, really.  You see the look on my uncle's face? Did you see how insulted          he was? What could I do? Waht are we supposed to do? You can't leave.          There's no excuse good enough to justify walking away from a conversation          with one of my relatives.  You could be a fireman on a fire truck on the way to a fire. You          bump into one of my relatives. 'I'm sorry Uncle Leo, there's a building          full of people burning down. I really do have to be running.' He'll go:          'Go. Go ahead. Go to your fancy fire. If that's what you have to do.'  Why didn't you shave this morning?  Why?  Is that Joe Davola?  I can't live tlike this. I'm being stalked.  Oh.  All right. Look. Now, you promised you're gonna be a little more          flexible on the nothing idea, okay? Jsut a little.  Wouldn't tune in.  No tune.  Just a huge massive coronary.  He couldn't believe it.  We would love to be in business. We'll do business. We're in business.          It's... it's business. This is business.  Your off-Broadway play.  Oh! Taht's judgment. Yes, yes. Judgment with earrings on. Yeah.  Yeah!  Now, all we gotta do is write it.  Thanks.  Thank you, thanks.  Phone call? Who knows I'm here?  Bye thanks.  Why?  She did, you insisted.  Nah!  oh, I d-I don't know. I d---  Okay.  Thirteen thousand.  No, for both!  Oh, would you stop with the Ted Danson?  You're nuts!  He's somebody.  You're nobody.  He's good, you're not.  You're worse, much much worse. (crouches in booth) That's Davola!  Outside! I saw him outside!  Go outside and see if he's still there.  Well, what are we supposed to do? I gotta take Kramer to the doctor.  Good idea.  Thanks.  What, are you ordering food now?  What happened to the muffin?  All of a sudden you get hungry?  No! Enjoy your lunch.  All of a sudden he gets hungry.  I know!  Well, either you see him or you don't.  This is really too much.  Well, I'm sitting over there waiting for you to finish your sandwich          for twenty minutes. Now you're drinking coffee, that's gonna be another          ten minutes.  Hey you guys!  What are you doing here?  Hey, is Davola outside?  Yeah.  Eleven dollars for what?  No.  I think you're getting a ticket.  Maybe this whole thing would be a good idea for the pilot.  Oh, like you know what you're talking about!  Bad.  Right. It's just an activity. It's like that paddle with                the ball and the rubber band.  I can't believe you all made me leave before the end of                the game.  Keep your shirt on. I got it.  Look at this guy. He's trying to box me out.  Oh, calm down, maroon Golf. He thinks I cut him off. He                accelerated.  How was it?  Yeah. They should make a movie about all the Hindenburg                flights that made it.  Heh.  Imagine the laugh you could have gotten if you'd yelled                that out at the actual disaster.  What is that music?  Oh, no.  See? If we had stayed, we could have seen those runs.   I don't know how you can unwind with that clock ticking.                It makes me anxious.  But that's a one-way street coming this way. Besides, how                am I gonna get all the way over there?  All right, I'm worming.  They're not letting me in.  Well, I think we're gonna need more than a hand. They have                to see a human face.  The stare-ahead. I hate that. I use it all the time.  One more lane to go.  Maroon Golf.  Could you move your car back a little?  You can't do that. You can't just leave the group.  Can you believe her?  Where are you going?  You're going to that again? Why? Just to do that stupid                line?  That's not what I do.  Maybe a little. Ah, hell, I guess it is.  I've gotta see this game. If it wasn't for this guy, we                could get out of here.  Walk away?  Isn't there a deductible?  I don't know.  From what?  We're not leaving the car!  Absolutely not. He sped up.  I'm ready to talk.  What's that?  Ok!  What's that on your forehead?  Hey, is that one of those laser pointers?  See ya around maroon Golf. And, by the way, that was an                "I'm not sorry" wave.  I'm glad I cut you off, because black Saab rules! So long,                jackass!   Elaine?!  So if everyone would just put their cars in reverse at the                same time, we can do this. All right, on the count of three. Can                everyone hear me? Hey, amigo, are you paying attention?  Not you! The guy in the Amigo.  Elaine, why did you have the cab come down the street?!                We were almost out!  Elaine, he doesn't need-  'Cause that's what's gonna happen.  I don't know.  Hold it, George. Don't move. It's right between your eyes.  Hey, there's the soda guy.  What seems to be the problem, officer?  At me?  Oh. It's back.  What if it gets in the side?  Yeah. Wouldn't it just bounce back and forth between your                cornea and the mirror, faster and faster, getting more and more                intense, until finally-  Oh. It's in your eye now.  Kramer, the Mets have got men on base!  You were watchin'? Where?  Oh, that was a strike! Did you see that?!   Eh...Varnsen. Kel Varnsen. Actually, this room intrigues                me. Why is it called the TV room?  Balk?! How was that a balk?! You have any snacks?  Not Pennypacker!  I wish I didn't. Brace yourself, madam, for an all-out bidding                war. But this time, advantage Varnsen!  Oh, hello...  Mr. Vandelay, of course.  Pennypacker.  Vandelay. Wait a second. Mr. Pennypacker, if you're here,                and Mr. Vandelay is also here, then who's watching the factory?  The Saab factory?  My car!  I love a parade!  Well, what about my car?  Hey, there's Elaine.  Well, you look, uh...relaxed.  Well, at least he didn't-  Somebody remember where we parked.  So why                didn't you tell her the code?  George,                you're gonna marry this woman. Most likely.  So you're                taking relationship advice from Chemical Bank now?  Actually,                that's the definition of selfish.  No one's                ever asked. You want it? It's 'Jor-El.'  Of course.                C'mon Georgie, you wanna tell me. It's eating you up  What if                my life depended on it?  My foot                fell asleep.  I crossed                my legs, I forgot to alternate.  Hey Fred.  My foot                fell asleep.  Fred, do                you know Elaine?  Seeya.  So?  And he                didn't remember you?  Where are                you going, you just got here?  Hey that                sounds great, I'd love to do some TV commercials, that should  Uh huh,                okay, alright, bye. Huh, how do you like that? I'm gonna do  What is                that?  Yeah, those                civil servants who risk their lives really got it made.  You're                lucky they let you drive a car.  (waving                his arm in dismissal) Eh.  Really?                I'm surprised, he doesn't meet that many women.  Well, what's                to be said? He didn't remember you.  I know.  Yeah, I                know.  Yeah, you                wrote a good piece on the Himalayan Walking Shoe.  Why would                I wanna do that?  Yeah, sounds                like fun.  Howbout                this, come one down to Leapin' Parry's if you can beat our  No I don't.  You know                what? I'll be with you in a minute.  Larry,                wait, you don't understand!  I didn't                do it on purpose, my foot fell asleep.  Ya know,                the guy has one leg and he still calls himself Leapin' Larry,  Yup.  Wow, the                whole building burned down.  Of course.  The amazing                thing is you never have any place to go.  We're gonna                meet Elaine and Peterman at the Chinese place.  Of course                not, if I did would you have gone?  There you                go.  Trust me,                you're off.  ...Alright,                you're locked up in a prison in Turkey, I have your wallet.   They're                closed.  Bomb threat.  Midnight                Express, my friend.  Yes, hi,                Mr. Peterman. This is, uh, George Costanza.  Well, is                Elaine here?  Without                Elaine? What for?  We gotta                get out of here. Come on; weave your web, liar man.  George,                what's the matter with you?  Actually,                you know I just remembered I promised this comedy club that  I can't                believe you blew us off; we were doing you the favor.  Fred?  You see                what's going on here? You're attracted to him because he can't  That's                God's plan. He doesn't really want anyone to get together.  Well, when                I heard you weren't coming I made up and excuse and got the  Nah, he                didn't make it.  I did not                bail out on you.   Why didn't                you come up with your own?  Ah, c'mon.                Maybe you're just in a slump?  Oh, come                on, just tell me your code already. What is it?  Fire station?  Nah, I                gotta go down to Leapin' Larry's.  Yeah, we                straightened it out, all is forgiven.  No I didn't.  Anyway,                thanks for having me back, and sorry about the misunderstanding.  Oh sure.                  Uh, again?                (Limping towards the door) I'll be right there.   Beats me.  Kramer?  Ah, that's                a shame.  Oh my god.                Look at this.  Which one you wanna go to shmoopy?  You're a shmoopy!  You're a shmoopy!   Uh,..we'll go to 3rd Avenue. So, can you come with us for                lunch to  All right, then. I'll see you later.  Bye shmoopy.  No. We gotta go to the soup place.   He's always raving. I finally got a chance to go there the                other  You can't eat this soup standing up, your knees buckle.  There's only one caveat -- the guy who runs the place is                a little  He yells and you don't get your soup.  Just follow the ordering procedure and you will be fine.  All right. As you walk in the place move immediately to                your right.   The main thing is to keep the line moving.  Right. It's very important not to embellish on your order.                No  Elaine.  Ar-moire.  He gave you the nice face discount.  What about the soup?  [in French accent] Pardon.  It's like this all the time.  Oh, no. It is. Just be still.  Hard to believe.  Shhhhh! All right, Bania, I - I'm not letting you cut in                line.  Because if he catches us, we'll never be able to get soup                again.  Medium crab bisque.   Just forget it. Let it go.  Oh, man. Ohh! This is fantastic. How does he do it?  I gave you a taste. What do you want?  I told you not to say anything. You can't go in there, brazenly  I'm sorry. This is what comes from living under a Nazi regime.  Hi shmoopy.  You're a shmoopy!  Hey, listen, so we'll meet you and Susan at the movie tonight?  Why?  Just like that?  Hey.  Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Wha -- what are you doing?  Well, sit on one of your couch cushions.  What are you gonna get?  You better decide, sister. You're on deck. Sheila!  Uh-oh.  Do I know you?  It was a bisque.  Really?  Have you tastes the soup?  See, the way I figure it, it's much easier to patch things                up with  Hey.  Oh, thanks.  So, did these thieves want any money?  They just wanted the armoire?  Yeah?  Hey, have you noticed George is acting a little strange                lately?  I don't know. A lot of attitude, like he's better than me,                or  Hello.  Absolutely not.  Aw, we didn't go. Sheila and I are kind of on the outs.  Yeah. Wha - wha - what are you, happy?  I don't know, but you look like you're happy.   You can't fool me. Don't insult me, George because I know                when  Is that so?  Disgusting?  Well, I guess I have all the more reason to get back with                her.  What?  You're still with the pact?  All I did was shake your hand.  It was stupid of me.  No. I know. I - I was really sort of half-kidding.  What about that Bavarian cream pie joke I told you? There's                no truth  So, am I forgiven, shmoopy?  Aw!  Oh, hi Susan, George. You remember Sheila.  Yeah. That's right. You got a problem?  Well, we're changing the rules.  What about you, shmoopy? How 'bout a little tuna? You want                a little  Yum yum little tuna fishy?  I'm heading over to Elaine's.  Those two?  Are you sure?  Well, let's confront 'em.  There's no cops around. They're gonna leave.

Elaine, I don't want you causing any trouble down at that                soup  Elaine, let the man make his soup!  Well. Well.  Hey, Susan, George.   Oh, really?  Because we're kind of not seeing each other anymore.  Yeah. Well, she was very affectionate - which I love. You                know I  Yeah. Too bad, 'cause you gotta have the affection - which                you  Oh, yeah. But the mental thing. But anyway. I'll see ya.  What is it?  Wha - wha - what's the matter?  Well, where are you going?  "I'm looking for a crested blazer"  "I've worn one once and I really think it did something                for me."  (softly) "Hmm.. they'll match my sneakers."  "You know...I'm not sure. I'll tell you what. I'll                come back later with someone  "Really I'll be back."

"Boy.. imagine.. liking wigs to the point it becomes                a career choice."  (proud of himself) "Remember me? I said I 'd come back                with someone and I did."  "Yeah.... well Elaine."  (impatiently cutting in) " Hey Elaine What about the                crest.? What d'you think of the crest  "You what??"  (giving up) "Check."  "You weren't supposed to say that."  "That's not the point. You put me in a position where                I had no choice."  "And what about that guy asking you out right in front                of me?"  "...'s very emasculating, he doesn't know the nature                of our relationship. You're  "Oh Come on!!"

And that guy is your new boss?   Right, they couldn't get the green stuff off.   Neither have I.   Where did you get this thing?   Hey, I got a date with that doctor you met.   Mmhu.   What's with you?   Your whole building smells like potatoes.   I think we might have one left in the stock room.   Well, I have this neighbor...   Is it anything like hitting a home run in softball?   Cause I hit a whopper last week!   He took out Kruger?   Where did you get that butcher's coat?   Eh, died on the table. Just spent hour and a half making me feel,          if I don't save lives, I'm worthless.   Dermatology?   Saving lives? The whole profession is; eh, just put some aloe          on it.   Oh, what's the point?   Revenge date? That sound like you more than me.   Dermatologist? Skin doesn't need a doctor!   You're right. I'm gonna call her right now and tell her off.   Flowers?   So, you've done this?   Well, I'm a classy guy. How's the life saving business?   It must take a really really big zit, to kill a man!   You call yourself a lifesaver. I call you pimple popper MD!   She saved your life?   Skin cancer! Damn.   He looks like a Peanuts character.   You can do that.   You can't do that. Well, maybe Kruger wasn't the place for you.          I understand.   True. You mean, for you?   What about your sea sickness?   I don't know if they have land guys.   Drawer.   What are they for?   Come again?   Eh, it went okay.   Yeah, I started out real classy...   But then I found out about the skin cancer.   Yeah.   Sadly, that knowledge could've help me.   Yesterday you said I had to get my revenge on her!   Must I?   How does that reflect me?   So again, I'm sorry. I had no right to yell at you, you're a life          saving doctor and I'm just a comedian...   Was it pimple popper MD?   Still got it.   What the hell is this?   No.   Nothing, I got up, run some errands, I went down to Sara's office          and apologized...   Well, I tried to apologise, it didn't go over that well...   What, she gave me hives?   She did kind of touch my face.   It does itch. Maybe I will go down at Kruger and talk to her.          I don't know, this? [Shows his neck to Sara.]   Where do you suppose that could've come from?   Come on Sitarides, cop to it. What brand of perverted science          do you practice?   I want the antidote, pimple popper!   Am I? You touched my face. I didn't imagine that!   So, Kramer pulled it off?   Well, that woman had it coming to her. Look at my neck, it looks          like I had a beard of bees!   I've called everyone. You know how hard it is to get a dermatologist          in this town? [Kramer comes in] A real dermatologist.   Hey, I wonder if they have a picture of my rash in here.   Hey, this looks like the thing I have. Caused by exposure to benzene,          a common ingredient in metal cleaners.   What are you doing?   That's my hand towel! I use that on my face, hands and chest!          That's where the hives are coming from! It's not from Dr. Sitarides, it's          from Dr. Van Nostrand!   Alright, get out. And take your Bronzo with you [throws the bottle          to Kramer.]   I can't believe Kruger didn't fire you after all you did.   Yeah, I finally got to see Dr. Kazarian. He said it was really          bad.   Aloe. So where's that lock smith?   Well this is it.  Oh, you're welcome. You know I think I ate too much of that                garlic.   No, I ate the whole plate. I didn't know those little things                were garlic.  No, I mean, I don't think so.  No, nah, I'm not happy and I'm not lucky, and I don't go.                If anything  That's not funny Naiomi. I didn't mean to be funny there.                Why don't you  This thing has never worked right.   Well, first of all Elmer Fudd is one of the most beloved                internationally known cartoon characters of   How could you leave a mesage like that on my machine.?  Because I didn't think anyone would leave it!  Well, now she's not going away for this weekend.  Well, it's better anyway. I mean really. What was going                to happen? I'm a comedian. How can I go out with a   Yeah but if I ask Elaine, Kramer will feel slighted.   Yeah, .. wait a minute do you smell smoke?   Ah, Kramer.  Will you put that thing out before you start another fire.                You had to give him a box of cigars.   Westchester? Isn't that a private club?  and GEORGE: ye, hu, um ye,   Too bad.   and GEORGE: No, no, no, no.  Yeah  They sell them by the side of the road.  Come on. I don't want to tag along with George and Susan.                If you're there it will be a better group.  Ah, it's an autographed picture for my dry cleaner. I don't                know what to write on these things.  Yeah, see that's why I hate it. So, come on, you going to                go?   Well, um same bed and uh, underwear and a tee shirt.   You'll be naked of course.  Yeah.  Oh, the Yoo Hoo? I love Yoo Hoo.   A bubble?  You get in the bubble with him?  Oh, I thought it was like an igloo.  Ah ha.  So you have no control over the remote?   That's nice!   Hu, well, tomorrow, I, ...  Yeah, uh, Ok, uh, tomorrow uh, where do you live, uh up                town? Upper west side?   Up state! Hummm.  He's a bubble boy.  Yes. a bubble boy.   He lives in a bubble.   No, that's what I thought but apparently it's just a big                piece of plastic dividing the room.   That's no good. He wouldn't last ten minutes in there. anyway                what can I do I promised I'd go visit him tomorrow.  I don't know, up state, Falls, somethin'  You think we can do it?  Oh, great. Ok we'll goin' away. I think I'm excited.  OK,   Ah, I don't know if he likes her as much as he likes it.                What's he doing? What is his hurry?  I know he once went from West 81st Street to Kennedy Airport                in 25 minutes.   What's he doing? Is he out of his mind? Do you see him?                I don't even think I see him anymore. Where is he?   No, no that's not him. What happened to him? I can't believe                it. I lost him. That stupid idiot.  I don't even know where the bubble boy lives. I don't even                remember the name of the town.   No, I was following him.  Because, HE'S my directions.   we make all these plans - he goes a hundred miles an hour                - the whole weekend's over - incredible - just like that -   I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DON'T KNOW WHERE I AM   (answering machine) Leave a message. I'll call you back.                Thanks.  <ranting> Can't believe how a little thing like George                going too fast - how my whole weekend is gone - the plans,  Why do you keep bringing up the bubble boy. You don't have                to mention the BB? You don't have to mention the BB.  I'll have a cup of coffee and a turkey club.   (whispers) You can't just have water.   Well this is not like a park bench where you just come in                and sit down. It's a business.   Oh, no.  Elaaaiinne...  Uh, I don't have anymore pictures Elaine.   I'm not lying.   She'll have a cup of copy and a broiled chicken.   Uh, THANKS! This is FUN! This turned out to be a GREAT weekend.                Oh, it's comin'. - Here ya' go.  No good?  Well.  Yeah, yeah, you're right. Excuse me, excuse me. would you                mind. I'd like to take the picture back. I'm not happy with what                I wrote.  No, believe me it's not good. I'll mail you a new one with                something really funny written on it.  No, look, you don't understand. I, I want the picture.   Look, I was nice enough to give you the picture. I don't                like what I wrote. I don't want it up there. Now please just give                it back to me.   I want that picture.   I'm not paying for anything until I get that back.  Well, maybe I'll just take it back. <Hits picture>  What are you doing? You're choking me. Elaine!   No, I want the picture back.  The BB? He lives around here?   What happened to you? You were going like a hundred miles                an hour.   Hey, Happy Birthday.   Fire engines?  Yeah, smoke.  Holy cow! look at that!  What are you two doin' here?  You didn't <makes motion like lighting a cigar>  Let me ask you a question. If you named a kid Rasputin do you          think that would have a negative effect on his life?  What are you doing? Were going out for dinner in ten minutes.  Yeah.  Come on up. . . . I never heard of this. Youve got to fast          for three days to take an ulcer test. How you gonna do that?  I think Ill take out the garbage.  Well, once I didnt have dinner until, like 9:00 oclock,          that was pretty rough. [exits to hall with garbage  meets George]          Hey, do me a favour will ya? Throw out my garbage for me.  Come on, its just down the hall.  Ill give you 50 cents.  Come on. Fifty cents. <??> a piece of Drakes coffee          cake  I dont get you. Who goes on vacation without a job? What          do you need a break from getting up at eleven?  Nah, I dont go for these non-refundable deals. I cant          commit to a woman. Im not going to commit to an airline.  Hi.  Gina, do you know what a Drakes Coffee Cake is?  How much do they cost?  No, no the junior.  Really? You should be ashamed of yourself. I want you out of here!          [MARTIN enters the hall] How ya doing?  Boy shes sexy isnt she?  Do you believe that guy?  My neighbour:  Yeah, did he think I was flirting with her?  Whats so amazing? Youve seen him before.  What was the dream?  I think Ive played there.  Youre a little paranormal   Psychics, vacations. How about getting a job?   Alright, come on, lets get out of here.  I heard he used to polish off a box of Triscuits.   Oh, yeah. Ghandi loved Triscuits.   Who is it? Who is it?  Who?  Martine?  Oh, Martin!  What?   In my pajamas? I better get my robe.  Itll take two seconds.  We dont have two seconds?  Nah, forget it.  Nah. Ill just wear the pajamas.  Are you sure?  Nah, Ill go get the robe.   Thats not too bad. Its not like a Sunny von Bulow          comma. The doctor said he should snap out of it anytime.   Really? Its over?  Oh boy, did he say anything about me?  He said that?  Im sorry if I caused any trouble. I was just being friendly.          You werent?  Of course.  Are you sure he cant hear anything? . . .MARTIN, MARTIN.  I, would, I would wait on that. I know how you feel but. Juries          today, you never know how theyre going to look at a thing like this.  No, I just wanted to see what time it was.   No.  Here?  Is this the proper venue?  No, no, I want to. I, I very much want to. I, I desire to. I,          I pine to.   I cant. What if he wakes up?  A man who respects a good comma. If it was one of those in and          out comas, maybe. But when a guys got a coma going like this           you dont want to mess with it.  Hey.   Yeah, I heard.  Who told you about Martin?  Hey, let me ask you something. How long do you have to wait for          a guy to come out of a coma before you can ask his ex-girlfriend out?  You know I dont get that whole suicide machine. Theres          no tall buildings where these people live? They cant wrap their          lips around a revolver like a normal person?   Well, I went with her to the hospital last night.  So were in the room and shes trying to get me to kiss          her right in front of him.   Nothing.  I didnt know what the coma etiquette was.   So youre saying, his girl, his car, his clothes, its          all up for grabs. You can just loot the coma victim.  So if the coma victim wakes up in a month, hes thrilled,          he got out of the coma. He goes home, theres nothing left?  You can say what you want about me but Ill be damned if          Im going to stand here while you insult my toothbrush.   No, more like the Three Stooges at the end of every movie.  Theyre a comedy team.  Well, theyre three kind of funny looking guys and they hit          each other a lot.  I will show you The Stooges.  Well, I dont really know where The Stooges are right now          but if I locate them you will be the first to know.  Well, uh, I uh, I dont want you to get upset or anything          but uh, with Martin and all, well maybe its not such a good idea          for us to be seen together in the building, because, you know, he had          a lot of friends here.  Well then what are all those ties and sport jackets doing in my          closet?  Yeah, all right. All right.  Hello Newman.  Do you think Newman would tell Martin if he wakes up? What kind          of sicko would do that? He could kill me.  Boy, its a good thing we came.  George, I want you to promise me something. If Im ever in          a comma. In the first 24 hours get everything out of my apartment and          put it in storage.   Looters.  Shes really hungry.  Hello.  Hows he doing?   Why wouldnt he?  Hell have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.   How up to date?  And nothing could change your mind?   Drakes Coffee Cake   From my house. I got a whole box of them.   Thats your big boy.  I dont give out bites. I got another one. But Im saving          it for later.   I dont think so. You know they, theyre so fragile.          You swear?  On your mothers life?  Elaine! No! No!  Hey!  What are you doing? Were going out to dinner in ten minutes.  What did she name the kid?  Hey.  osh.  Woah. [hitting George]  Wow! [hitting George]  Oh! [hitting George]  Oh! [hitting George]  Nude backgammon with swimsuit models!  Oh, its an invitation to a house warming from Martin and          Gina.  Yeah, its some place down in the village.   Yeah.  All right were coming down.  Were taking Elaine to dinner. Shes got to start the          fast again. Um, you want to go?  You can't just *have* an adultery-- you *commit* adultery.                And you  Produce section. *Very* provocative area. A lot of melons                and   Tonight.  I... don't... know...  I was a little nervous, I got distracted. It has something                to do   Look at that. Why do I get bananas? They're good for *one*                day...  Yeah, I did that too.  Sure.  Wow!  Y'know I have friends who try to base their whole life on                that   Nobody you know...  Why don't you put it in the *bank*?  *Oh*, you mean you wanna *lose* it...  What, you rented "Home Alone"?  I thought you saw that already...  Oh, right... But you *hated* it!  What for?  Because if I watch it at my apartment I feel like I'm not                doing   What's wrong?  You said "gloves"...  Right, the "triangle" guy.  Yeah, you liked him. What happened with him?  Artsy?  Oh.  Oh, you want me to pretend to be your boyfriend.  Well I think I can do that. I believe I've played that role                before   Y'know a lot of people have asked that...  Jerry, uh, I'm the boyfriend.  That's terrible...  You know I can't get this damn thing to sleep...  Honey... Aren't we going to the Poconos next Friday?  No, I believe it's next week.  No I'm not...  Hey Doc, check this out. [does an around-the-world] I *just*                I dunno...  Yeah, that's true...  Hey.  What are doing, you crying??  You crying from "Home Alone"??  Alright, just get yourself together... I dunno if I can                be friends  Oh, I never even got to the gym. Kramer got the gloves and                wanted  Oh, he's okay. In fact him and Elaine are getting pretty                chummy.  Yeah, so she and "Triangle Boy" can go out to                fancy restaurants.  You mean Florence Nightingale.  Yeah, you must have meant Clara Barton.  I'm not sure, but I think she was nice.  Yeah, I think you would.  No. Why don't you buy it? You got 1 900 dollars.  I will.  No, it isn't. I can find out.  There are ways.  Y'know I remember when I was a kid growin up, kids would                make fun   Yeah. What about you? Did people make fun of your name?  Oh... *you*...  No.  "Hest"? That's not a name.  I know, I should've asked her.  I dunno. I can't ask her now; I've already made out with                her. Once   No...  Alright, that's enough.  How am I gonna do that?  You asked a date to go to the operation?  Mulva?  Alright, alright. Just let me finish my coffee... then we'll                go   What are you eating?  No...  Where'd you get those?  I don't want any!   I don't want any!   No! Kramer, stop it!  ...Over the balcony, bounced off some respirator thing *into*    Into the patient, *literally*!  Yes, the hole!  No!  Because it's a little mint. It's a *Junior* Mint.  They sealed him up with the mint inside.  Yes!  They *eat* them, they don't put them next to vital organs                in their   Why did you force that mint on me? I didn't want the mint!  How could you not believe me?!?  That's true.  Well, just don't say anything about this to Elaine...  Prognosis *negative*!?  We gotta confess.  Yes!  I can't have this on my conscience. We're like Leopold and                Loeb!  I'm telling and you can't stop me!  Oh yeah, that's the spot...  Oh, nothing really... Just a homicide. [She finds the right                spot   Mulva?  My Aunt's name is Mulva. She's a masseuse.  Oh, good idea...  Oh, I was just looking for some... gum or... mint.  No! [throws her purse back at her] No, I mean, no thank                you...  [whispering] No, you better get out of here. No, wait a                second...  Hey, there's a name you don't forget.  No, I haven't heard anything.  Really...  Yeah, I'm sure...  Well, I gotta call the Hospital. I gotta tell 'em what happened.  Why?  Look, I gotta try and help the guy.  Yes I'd like to speak to Dr. Siegel... it's about Roy Kordic's                Oh, thats *fantastic*!  Thank you very much. Bye-bye. He's gonna be okay!  What do you mean?  I don't think so...  I believe we're not...  Well, I'll think about it...  Really...  Oh, what're you saying, you got her autograph?  Do you have it with you?  Let me see.  Yeah, I know...  Yes I do.  It, uh, rhymes with a female body part.  Mulva...  Gipple?  Loleola?  Oh! Oh! *Delores*!  Ages zero through ten, candy is your life. There's nothing                else.  So, Puddy wear's a man fur?  And, of course, you find fur morally reprehensible.  You might want to get a look at that bathing suit drawer.  Kramer said it's a perfect gift. That's what we're gettin'                him.  Cheapness is not a sense.  I had a great time at the last one. I was in charge of the                music. I turned that mother out.  Hey.  What, has Newman got another army man stuck in his ear?  But then anyone can just look in and see you.  Hey, George. Here's the model number on that chair, by the                way.  What?  That's a five.  Except the store's in Delaware.  Maybe cheapness is a sense. You know it is better without                this big wallet. It's more comfortable.  Why?  But look at this thing. It's-it's huge. You got more cow                here than here.  Irish money?  Show this card at any participating Orlando-area Exxon station...to                get your free 'Save the Tiger' poster.  George, I am loving this no wallet thing.  You know, the very fact that you oppose this makes me think                I'm onto something.  Hey, Joe Mayo. Nice place.  Music?  But I could do that and the music.  I was ready to get jiggy with it.  Hey, Elaine.  So, Elaine, notice anything different about my... pants?  So, we're givin' him nothing?  Did you at least get him a card?  Hi, I'm Jerry. How do you like my pants?  (talking to George) It's working. (to the girl, who's tapping                on the aquarium) Don't tap on the glass.  Because you threw it out.  But you did actually throw his coat out the window.  But that's you.  Of course. Because of that wallet. You-you got a filing                cabinet under half of your ass.  What was that?  All set. I can't believe I'm going dancing.  No, because it's so stupid. Shall we?  Compact, lipstick, all this?  What are you, a medieval dungeon master?  Ow! Sharp key.  You don't understand. I went on a successful pocket diet,                and I want to keep that weight off.  Not more of that crap from the Titanic?  I'm not carrying a purse.  Oh.  I don't know.  Hey, George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?  What?  No.  Well, so what? You're gettin' a deal, right? We'll split                it three ways.  What is that noise?  You know, sometimes I get the feeling George isn't being                completely honest with me.  What was that pop sound?  It's European.  Uh, yeah, I think I do. I can never find anything in here.                Ah, here it is. So, that Joe Mayo throws the worst parties, doesn't                he? So what was your job?  What, he doesn't like my taste in music?  You should've been there last year. I got jiggy with it!  I have to do what?  I'm not wearing the fur.  Is that right?  Newman, too?  That's my walkman!  All right.  George, did you get that chair yet?  You know what? Just call up and cancel it. I'm out.  Joe Mayo doesn't like my taste in music. He's not gettin'                a gift from me.  No, you don't have to buy anything.  I don't understand. Why didn't you tell us you had it?  Because of your giant wallet. Just get rid of it!  Your good friend is morbidly obese.  It's not a purse. It's European!  All right.  How do I look?  Hey, Silvio, just out for a little stroll in my favorite                fur coat.  It sure is.  That's true.  Oh, thanks.  Maybe this isn't my coat.  No, it's not. It's mine. I'm a fancy boy.  Hey! Officer! Someone took my European carryall!  The...black, leather...thing with a strap.  Yes, a purse. I carry a purse!  So, Silvio ambushed Joe Mayo?  He should have had a reverse peephole.  Hello? Hello?  I guess we like to think we've progressed beyond a knife                fight for a   Restaurants too?  Yea especially ziti, with that big hole.   Tell him forty and no fork.  How about we leave and come back in a week?  Look at the size of that neon light.   He is the gambler.   Try and stay calm.   Seth! Wow what has it been like five years?  You wanna grab lunch?  Seth it's me. What's more important than catching up with                an old   Blow it off. Remember Poli Sci? How many of those did we                go to?  Whatever happened to Moochie?  Is that right?  Pretty good, as a matter of fact. I almost had my own show                in Japan.   No   I don't know. So what's this job of yours?  The meeting you blew off?  Wasn't that kind of important?  You use a water pick?  So you go in the bathroom at eleven your in bed by what                two?  Hello, anybody?  Hey, why didn't you get the big one?  I don't believe it.   Ah, too bad you got a little George Costanza thing going                on.   That's a date?  How do you make sure your gonna get to the third date?  That's so old. Why don't you show up at her door in a wood                horse?  "By Mennen"  What's going on in there?  The light!  Can't you shut the shades?  Yea? What'd he say?  Seth, if you knew the meeting was so important why did you                go the   I only knew you through Moochie.  Actually I haven't read Tank McNamara yet.  How's life on the red planet?  Well, did you go down to the Kenny Rogers and complain?  What are you doing?  That's tomato juice.  I don't know Kramer, my only concern is that ....  ..living together after a while we might start to get on                each others   Or I could sleep in the park? You could knock these walls                down, make   Yea, that's no good.   How you gonna do that?  Seth?  I think your taking the trash out for this chicken place,                but that   But your were an executive, this is fast food.  That's not going to be good for anybody.   If I'm gonna live over there, you gotta take some of this                stuff out.   And one other thing, I don't want Newman using my...   Oh no.   Well don't get too comfortable, as soon as Seth gets a real                job you two   Hey everybody, I'm on no sleep, no sleep!. You don't know                what it's   Oh I'm stressed!  You know my friend Bob Sacamano?  Well, he called last night about 3 a.m. we got to talking,                he sells  No, but the difference is unnoticeable.   Giddee up!  Seth, you're the manager, can't you turn off the sign?  Hello Newman.   Hold it, Newman, you wouldn't eat broccoli if it was deep                fried in   Really? Then maybe you'd like to have a piece?  It's Kramer isn't it? The greasy door knob the constant                licking of   Expecting Newman? That's funny because I happened to find                him at   He was buying quite a load of chicken almost for two people,                as long   I sure do miss my apartment maybe I'll switch back.  I don't think you will. As a matter of fact I'll save you                the trouble,   Alright.  You got a little problem.   Hey Seth, man it is coming down hard out there.   Oh, gross. That's not gonna be good for business.   Home at last.   Is someone there? Mr. Marbles?  So what happened to you yesterday? We were supposed to go to the          auto show, I waited for you, you never came.  Five minutes.   What's the difference? You never showed up.  Well, we barely knew the guy.  That's the way it works.  I told him to meet us here in ten minutes. How long has it been?  That's enough. <They leave. George comes around the corner.>  How did you know about that?  He can't do that.  What happened?  Fantastic.  You're still doing that?  When you feel guilty.  What are you gonna do there?  Yes, I know, I know.  It was a mistake, the bank sent me the wrong ones.  Is he from the future?  Again, I'm really sorry about the check, Marcelino.  But it's your bodega.  You asked her out?  How could you ask her out?  I remember when you wouldn't date that girl who lived in Queens          because you didn't want to go over the bridge!  I'll say.  Conjugal visit?  George is dating a convict.  Yeah, sure. You don't even have a fridge, do you?  Kramer, wait a minute, what the hell is that?  I sense something is afoot.  Allow me. What are you, an idiot?  Is that your "chicken" making all that noise?  Who?  Thanks, that's very sweet, but that is   Well, you picked out a rooster.  Hello?  I'm not having money problems.  I'm not calling Ed Roydlick. I'm doing fine! <George enters.>  You are NOT sending me fifty dollars!  Ma! Ma! MA! <Hangs up the phone in disgust.>  Good.  I thought you were going out with Celia.  Having her in jail.  Yeah, dating a convicted felon. I don't know how you missed it.  Huh. Kurt's an organ donor.  So he just shaves his head for no reason?  It's just hair.  It's brown.  So?  So Marcelino's going to take down the check?  Great! <realizing> What?  Ah ha...  Kramer, cockfighting is illegal.  It's inhumane!  It's two roosters peckin' at each other!  Yeah!  No Kramer, Little Jerry could get hurt.  Hey, did you get Little Jerry, is he O.K.?  You let him fight?  How long do they usually last?  Great!  I'm too tired.  Alright. <Kramer leaves.>  Ah, I'm so sorry.  In other words, a normal relationship.  Well, she'll still be an ex-con.  Hey, if you two are meant to be together...I'm sure the cops'll          pick her up on something.  Then what is my check still doing up? We had a deal!  New deal?  This is outrageous! (To Marcelino) Pack of Juicy Fruit.  85 cents?   Kramer, Marcelino wants us to sell him Little Jerry Seinfeld.          But Kramer, cockfighting is an illegal and immoral activity.  No, no more cockfighting. Let's just sell him to Marcelino the          cockfighter and be done with it!  Of what?  Kramer, give me that rooster!  Kramer won't sell.  Well, thank you, Marcelino.  You want Little Jerry to take a dive?  First of all, I don't think you can make a rooster take a dive.  Second of all, Jerry Seinfeld - big or little - doesn't go down          for anyone, anywhere, at anytime! Now I'd appreciate it if you please          leave.  We'll see about that. <Runs to the window and shouts up to          Kramer, who's on the roof.> Kramer, I'm comin' up! We got a cockfight          to win!  Yeah. Alright, I think that's enough for today. <Kramer picks          up Little Jerry and takes him to the sink.> Little Jerry is lean, mean,          peckin' machine! <Kramer starts filling a pot with water.> What          are you doing with that?  Hey, Kramer...?  Be careful. <George enters.> Hey, guess what! Little Jerry          ran from here to Newman's in under thirty seconds!  I don't know. Where have you been?  Oh my God! The break-out/pop-in!  Marriage is a big step, Elaine. Your life'll totally change.  Where's Celia?  Hey, how's he doin'?  Look at the size of his bird!  He's a ringer!  Kramer!  Yeah, they have been promising that for a while..  I think Ed Begley Jr. has one.  What about Harrison Ford? He had one in, uh, Blade Runner.                That was a cool one.  Well, what do you think the big holdup is?   Yeah, right. And what about the floating cities?   It's like we're living in the '50s here.   (To Kramer) Would you stop it? You'll have plenty of time                to destroy it after I get it. Hey, George, I'm buyin' this car.                (Gestures to a black Saab)   (Talking about the vein in Georges head) There's that                vein again.   (Trying to quiet George down) It'll be twenty minutes. I                told ya, Puddy's getting me an insider deal.   I guess he graduated.   (To Kramer) Thank you.   Alright. Calm down.   (To Kramer) Alright, were goin in.   (Scolding) George. (To salesman) Sorry, were just                waiting for David Puddy.   Hey.   Ah. Whered you go?   So, Puddy, I decided Im gonna go with another 900                convertible.   (As George is leaving for the donuts) Au revoir, Le George.                So, Puddy, this is a pretty good move for you, huh? No more                "grease monkey".   Oh. Sorry, I didnt know..   I saw one once that could do sign language.   Yeah, Koko.   No. We both just saw the same monkey.   (Getting a dollar out) Wheres your money?   Hey, Elaine, have you noticed your boyfriend has developed                an annoying little habit?   No.   No. He keeps asking me to give him a high-five.   Slapping hands is the lowest form of male primate ritual.                In fact, even some of them have moved on - theyre using sign                language now.   What do you think the Nazis were doin? (Imitates the                Nazis salute) That was the heil-five.   (Slightly embarrassed) It was a good bit in the 80s,                and its still relatable today.   (Tapping the door you lift to retrieve your candy on the                machine) I think the candy comes out over there.   Either that, or theyve got a little hang-up about                lying face-down in filth. Why dont you just go to the cashier?                How much was under there?   (While fishing through his pocket for change) Hey, Puddy                thinks I should go for the CD player. What do you think? (Hands                him a nickel)   Hey, can I have my dollar back?   (Sees Elaine leaving) Hey! Wh-where are you..?   Did you two break up?   "Rust-proofing"?   "Finders fee"? It was on the lot!   Keys"?!   Hey, George!   No, last one. Listen, you gotta help me out. Elaine and                Puddy just broke up, hes treatin me just like a regular                customer, now!   (Threatening tone) So, listen, Puddy. When we first started                this deal, I thought things were gonna be different. Now, if you                want to play hard ball, I got my  George! Can we focus on the car, here?   Yellow? I wanted black.   (Pleading) George, could you help me, please?   Sing it, sister!   (Exasperated) Uhhh..   (To Puddy) Ill be right back.   Hey, George!   (Over the phone) Elaine, youve got to get back down                to the dealer. Puddy is screwin me on this car, which is yellow                now!   (Banging the phone against the booth) Elaine!   You gotta get back together with Puddy so I can make this                deal.   Youre gonna get back together, anyway. Its thousands                of dollars!   Come on. Then you dont have to see him again til                my 15,000-mile check.   Fine.   No. No lunch.   Alright! Lunch!   Bye. (Hangs up)   (Frustrated, he reacts) Everybodys ripping me off!                No, no. No, Elaine, the car can wait. Whats important                is you two getting back together. Eh, then well talk about                the car.   Okay. Now, I know this is an important decision. Why dont                we all just sit down and talk about it? Come on, come on. Now, look,                you both find each  Clearly, no one else can stand to be with either one of                you..   (Smiling, like a salesman) Alright. Now, what do I have                to do to put you two in a relationship today?   Alright. Elaine, David, I believe we have a deal here in                principle: Arbys - no more than once a month. In exchange,                Elaine comes to your softball game, and  So, youre back together?   Alright, alright. Alright, thats enough! Lets                get back to my deal. That undercoating, thats just a rip-off,                isnt it, David?   So, Im gettin the insiders deal?   And where does it end? Then, everyones doin                it. Its like the wave at ball games. Air quotes. The phrase,                "Dont go there." - Someones gotta take a  And who were you tryin to set up, anyway? The mechanic                or the manager?   I think theres a mental hospital near here.   You know doctor is supposed to be such a prestigious occupation.                But   Then he asked you out?  On your heart?  Doctor? Hes a podiatrist.  Anyone can get into podiatry school. *George* got into podiatry                Oh hi.  Yes, Ill be stopping. See you later. (to Elaine) Well                we cant all   How did you get in?  Looks like a swan.  Shes limiting herself to Latvian Orthodox? Too bad.  Mmm, succulent.  To Latvian Orthodox?  You know its not like changing toothpaste.  Yeah well King Edward didnt live in Queens with Frank                and Estelle   Oh yeah.  Oh I dont know. Not always. No I uh I had to work                at it. When I   To wash my hands. Theyre sticky from the orange.   Right there.  (thinking to himself) "Fungicide". Fungus?  Fungicide. I mean what could she have?  I said I was coming down with the flu or something and I                had to go   I didnt open it. It was open. I just nudged it a little.  I was not snooping. I did not break the seal. There was                no breaking   Why dont you ask that doctor what it is?  But thats what podiatrists do. They deal in fungus.                Theyre knee-  What?  Thats all there is to it.  And when is Brother Costanza planning on telling Mother                Costanza?  Oh a slinky. Where did you get it?  Why did she give you that?  What do you mean she liked you?  You picked up on a vibe, from a nun.  Oh hi.  (weakly) A little better. *fake cough*  Okay. All right bye.  Shes subletting Carols place for a month.  Yeah but theres a problem. I found a tube of a fungicide                in her   So I dont know what shes using it for.  I didnt even think to look.  Yeah.  Yeah Ive got this old bottle of cough medicine.  Hi. Can I use your bathroom?  Fine all done, just looking for the soap.  No I dont see it.  Okay, Latvius was the son of which apostle?

So I need                the tube   I like the button fly.  That is one place on my wardrobe I do not need sharp interlocking  I have to go meet Nina. Want to come up to her lot, check                out her  Theres nothing to get.  She does a lot of abstract stuff. In fact she's painting                Kramer  She sees something in him.  Why?

(walking over to where Kramer is posing) Hey, look at this                guy!  (to Nina) I brought George up to see some of your paintings.  May I? (pantomimes making a big "X" across the                painting)  What's this?  (sincerely disappointed) Oh, Saturday...

Come on.  I'm going to be this guy's friend.  New clothes?  Strange. For new pants, there's noticable wear on the buttocks                of those chinos. Wait those are the clothes from the bag!  He asked you to watch them not wear them.  You look like a tourist.  When you hear like a soft russeling.  Oh right, the new job, how is it?  So who's the new you?  Oh hi Alex.  No.  Right here, George. In here. (pointing to his chest) Try                opening this up. You'll find the biggest dating scene in the world.  (yelling) Get out! Get out! I don't want to live like this.  Hmm. That looks new.  (uncomfortably) Yeah that's too bad.  (uncomfortably) Nothing.  I did something stupid.  Well I was shaving. And I noticed an asymmetry in my chest                hair and I was trying to even it out. Next thing I knew, (high pitched                voice) Gone.  Well women do it.  Well what am I going to tell Alex?  Um hum.  Hey!  You couldn't pay me enough to go to the beach on a weekend.                I mean it's hard enough...  Really?  So you're pretending to be a tourist?  How do you explain your apartment?  you moved into a hotel?  So get this: we're in the park today Alex goes wild for                this hairless dog.  So. I figure since she likes one hairless animal why not                another.  Are you nuts? I don't want her to think I'm one of those                low-rise briefs guys who shaves his chest.  The last thing this guy's qualified to give a tour of is                reality.  You're moving to New York? That's fantastic. I can see you                all the time now.  What is it she think you can't do?  How did you do those things?  Hey, what were you doing with that bus yesterday?  "The Real Peterman Reality Bus Tour". I'm confused.  Nobody wants to go on a three hour bus tour of a totally                unknown person's life.  Yeah. $37.50 for a Three Musketeers.  What? Can't I get a moment's peace?  I can't stop. Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.   Oh that's an old wives tale.  Oh come on. That's genetics. That's not going to happen                to me.  Why do I have to go on the tour?  Hey, how's business?  You also shouldn't use a donut.  Can we just go?  You know I never though he would be able to recreate the                experience of actually knowing him, but this is pretty close.  What's that?  Oh. Yeah.   (in low voice to next to Kramer) Kramer how much longer?                My chest hair is comming back and it's itching me like crazy. I                can't let her see me scratch it.  I'm telling you man, I'm losing it.  I can't sit on this bus anymore. I think I'll go play with                that dog.  (for the first half of the howl, a dog howls along with                him.) Awoooooo-oooooooo, that feels good.  Ready to go Lois?  Excuse me Lois. Stand back Lois. Jimmy's in trouble Lois.  Duncan Meyers!  Well, I'd have to be Superman to do that Lois.  Hi oh.  She couldn't make it.  I know, finally. But George, guess who her boss is. Duncan Meyers.  Elaine, only one other person in the world knows what I am about          to tell you and that's George. When we were in the ninth grade they had          us all line up at one end of the school yard for this big race to see          who was going to represent the school in this track meet.  I was the last one on the end. George was next to me. And Mr.          Bevilacqua, the gym . . .   Mr. Bevilacqua, the gym teacher.  He was down at the other end. So he yells out, "Ready, On          your mark, Get set, " and I was so keyed up I just took off. By the          time he said go I was ten yards ahead of everybody.  By the time the race was over I had won. I was shocked nobody          had noticed the head start.  And I had won by so much a myth began to grow about my   I never did. In four years of high school I would never race anyone          again. Not even to the end of the block to catch a bus. And so the legend          grew. Everyone wanted me to race. They begged me. The track coach called          my parents. Pleading. Telling them it was a sin to waste my god given          talent. But I answered him in the same way I answered everyone. I chose          not to run.   He's back. And I knew he would be someday. (drinks) Man   Hi.  Oh, so am I . Uh, how's Duncan?  He say anything?  Oh, nothing in particular.  I did not cheat.  Oh, he's just jealous because he came in second.  Yes  Faster than a speeding bullet Lois.  I couldnt tell her the truth. I don't know what's going          to happen between us. What if we have a bad breakup. She'll go straight          to Duncan. And I want him to go to his grave never being certain I got          that   Wow, a communist. That's something.  The Daily Worker has personal ads?  Wow, look at you. So you got the job.  Hello, Oh hi Lois, you want to get together, what for? I don't          know about that, I'll have to think about it. I'll let you know. Okay,          bye.  Duncan wants to get together with her and me for lunch tomorrow.          He obviously wants me to admit I got a head start. And I don't think she          believes me.  That's not bad.  I didn't hit puberty til the 9th grade. That's what gave me my          speed. Besides, if I got a head start why didn't Mr. Bevilacqua stop the          race?  Well, I . . . [sees George]  I'm sorry, uh,   Oh, George Costanza , Kennedy High.  This is Lois.   I'm I'm a comedian.  Yeah, yeah   Yeah, yeah, Well, you really got bald there, didn't you?   You really used to have a think full head of hair.  yeah, yeah.  Well you've really built yourself up into something.   Well, one cannot help[ but wonder what brings you into a crummy          little coffee shop like this.  Ah, you know you have a hole in your sneaker there. What is that          canvas?  George, George, hang on. I haven't seen you in so long.   I thought we might reminisce a little more. You know Duncan and          I were just taking about the big race.   Yeah.   George!   Did I get a head start?   You satisfied? So you see?  No, no, no, another race - out of the question.   All right! I'll do it. The race is on.  And he's calling all these people from High School to come and          watch. I knew this day would come. I can't do it. I can't go through with          it. I'm calling it off. I can't let the legend die. It's like a kid finding          out there's no Santa Claus   So you'll just explain to him you're not a Communist.   Hello, oh hi Duncan, 4:00 o'clock tomorrow? That is not   Hi how are you?  What's the matter?   What? He can't do that.  Don't worry Lois. I'll think of something.  I need a miracle.   Yes, Mr. Beviacqua  Maybe I will , Lois. Maybe I will.   Let me speak with the head librarian. ... Because it's absurd.                An overdue book   Ya' got me I fell for it. Alright, OK I can be down there                in like a half hour.   This you're not goin' to believe. The NYPL says that I took                out Tropic of Cancer   It doesn't work like that.  It's not going to be anything. I returned the book. I remember                it very vividly   That orange dress is burned in my memory   I wonder what ever happened to her.  Oh, computers, they're cracking down now on overdue books.                The whole thing is   It's George. Wait 'til he hears we're going to the library  <to speaker> Coming down.  I gotta go to the library. You want to go?  Where's George  I kinda like those sticks. I'd like to get them for my house.  This woman's completely ignoring me.  Eventually a little shot of penicillin  Yes I called before. I got his notice in the mail.  Can I speak with this Bookman?  What?  Who?  Yeah.  <whispers> Are you sure?  George got him fired. He squealed on him.  Oh, he sang like a canary.  Not here? Why was I told to come down here?  Well what am I supposed to do now?  All right Thanks. Come on lets go  So they forgot to get your lunch. Big deal!  I remember he made you wear a jock on your head for a whole                class. And the straps   I had him for Hygene. Remember his teeth. It was like from                an exhumed corpse.   Echh  He got fired the next day.  They also have an atomic wedgie. Now the goal there is to                actually get the   Well what do girls do ?  Oh, I'm glad you're here, so we can get this all straightened                out. Would  Coffee?  No, I don't drink coffee.  No, I don't have--  Well, I don't normally--  I don't.  Really? I'll have to remember that.  Yes, and I returned it in 1971.  Look, Mr. Bookman. I--I returned that book. I remember it                very  I try.  No, I don't.  Certainly not.  No way I'm payin' that! I returned that book I n 1971. I                have a witness   So Sherry, what do you remember about that day at the library?                Purple? Ya' sure it wasn't orange?   No Black Jack?   Tropic of Cancer.  Tropic of Capricorn?   Wait a second. Wait a second. You're right. I had both of                them.   Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything                happen to it.   Ok, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's hygiene.                It was nice seeing you again. I just remembered something.                I've got to go.   Maybe you're getting' a raise.   Wait 'til I tell him about the book.  I'm right here.  Columbus, Euro trash.  That was double overtime.  So Georgie Boy, guess what happened to TROPIC OF CANCER  Because I gave it to you.   Yesah, think. Don't you remember you kept begging me to                see it then finally   Here's the book. Don't let anybody see it. Don't let anything                happen to it.   All right, I'll see you after school. I.m late for Hayman's                hygiene.   Anyway, I hope there's no hard feelings.  What is your problem?  (after Bookman exits): That is one tough monkey! <turns                to Elaine>   Oh, beautiful did he like them?   <to George> Was he out there?  I guess we'll never know.  Were you talking? I couldn't hear anything.  Oh, Noel! Yeah, the one who plays bongos...  All right, I'm sorry. What about her?  I know, you told me you like her, everything is going good.  We all want the hand. Hand is tough to get. You gotta get                the   Yeah, that sounds like somethin'...  That smells good, what is that?  The *beach*?  You joined the *Polar Bears*?!  Yeah... So's shock therapy.  [with glee] What is that, a Pez dispenser?!  You don't know?  You think they have fleas there, don't you?  Yes you do, Biff. You've never been to a Flea Market, and                you   They have a piano backstage they warm up on.  What, do you think they just crack their knuckles and come                out?  [quickly whispering] I resent that you said that! That's  Is this okay? Can I do this? (he claps)  I dunno, it was an impulse.  How could I know she would start to laugh?  Can we just go in already?  What about?  I know, but I'm distracted now.  Really John Mollika, they guy that used to bartend at the                Comedy Club. How's he doing?  "Cut to the chase"?  What're you, "Joe Hollywood"?  I would lose that.  "Lose that"? That's not a Hollywood expression!  Really, an intervention ...  Me? Why me?  Y'know these things are *really* hard to load...  We've got to talk about this (to Elaine)  You play a *Hell* of a piano.  Pez?  Anyone who would laugh at a recital is probably some sort                of lunatic anyway. I mean only a sick twisted mind could be that                rude and ignorant.  Even if this so called mental defective did put something                on her leg she's still the one who laughed.  We'll be outside  It was nice meeting you By the way, How do you warm up your                fingers before you play?  You know I thing Kramer might have been responsible for                getting Richie involved with drugs in the first place.  A few years ago the comedy club had a softball team. Kramer                was our first baseman You couldn't get anything by him It was unbelievable.                What happened? The guy was like 67 years old, it was freezing                out, he caught a cold, got pneumonia,   All the comedians were happy. He was one of these club owners                nobodu liked anyway. But Richie was never the same.  He's the same!  Are you sure you want me John. I have spoken to Richie in                two years. I don't have a good apartment for   Right, we'll John Mollika is organizing some kind of intervention                for him. We're having it here.   What do you think? It's like a poker game?  Yeah  Yeah, but John invited her.  No, intervene, go intervene all you want. I am just afraid                you might be interfering while we're intervening.   Stop smelling your arm.  Hum, a cologne that smells like the beach. I can't believe                I'm saying this, "That's not a bad idea."  Why don't you call Steve D'Jiff, he works in the marketing                department at Calvin Klein.   She broke up with you?  What was on the list?  Yeah, Postum is under-ratted,   What's wrong with lunch?  A preemptive breakup.   In the freezer.  Well I guess there aren't any ice cubes.  Do I have to talk? I don't feel like talking.  Hey.  Intervention.  No, we're having an intervention  There's a friend of ours on drugs and we're going to confront                him.  It's NOT a surprise party! Yeah (to intercom)  Yeah, come on up. ... It's not him.  We're having the intervention for Richie.  Well, uh..  Well, you're looking well.  I didn't know she would laugh.  Hey Richie  It was pretty ugly from the get go. he's not listening,                He's hostile, he's  So he starts to get up He spots the Pez dispenser on the                coffee table   He picks it up - he stares at it - It's like he's hypnotized                by it. Then he's  Tell me something I don't know. So as the father's trying                to load it he loses control  So as he's telling the story he starts crying.   What do you think? I gave him my Pez dispenser.  Two hours later he checks into Smither's clinic. I talked                to the doctor yesterday.  I can't do those things.  So, I'm on line at the supermarket. Two women in front of                me. One of  Cheque. Now, the fact is, if it's a woman in front of you                that's  What's that one?  Maybe they came back for Chinese food. Y'know Maureen Stapleton,                if  Oh yeah? I don't believe you've seen... this.  Yeah...  "So, uh, what's your son doing now, Dr. Stevens?"  Pamela? Do I know her?  Oh yeah, right...  [quickly] No.  Riverside Drive.  Well, what is it?  Wait a second, wait a second. We could work out a little                deal here.  I will go to that, if you go with me to a little family                wedding I   Y'know, my parents are coming in for this...  Yeah, tomorrow.  No, no... Still doin' the big *sweep* across.  Doesn't think anyone can tell?  So c'mon, do we have a deal?  There's a lot of people to mock...  Great!  Was I supposed to bring something?  I met her *one* time...  What did you say then?  Hi, happy birthday.  I didn't bring anything.  Oh, Okay (turns to rest of table) I'm sorry, I didn't know                what  I'm in for five...  [To himself] Uh-oh... What do we have here...  Oh, I can't-- I have a tendency to get chilly.  Plus I'm wearing short sleeves, I don't want to expose my                tattoos.  [To himself] What's going on here? Gotta be her boyfriend,                she's  Friend of a friend. And you?  [To himself] Oh no, not *now*...  Oh really... [To himself] Oh God, I gotta get out of this...  No kidding... [To himself] Why is this happening? Please,                make   [To himself] This is *brutal*...  How do you like that... [To himself] Can I turn now? Is                this   Yes, I *heard* you.  [To himself] Thank *you*, Pamela!  [To Vanessa] So, you're a lawyer...  [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim                and Taft.   Imagine, spelling "Mom" with two O's...  Comedian.  [To himself, quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim                and Taft.  [To himself] I can't believe it-- I got *nothing*! I don't                even   [To himself, *very* quickly] Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim                and   That wasn't so bad, really...  Why? What did I do?  I was listening!  No, you were talking about the, the um, the dream you had.  Where you had, uh, wooden teeth.  Alright, so *I* had wooden teeth, so what?  Apparently Plato, who came up with the concept of the platonic                Hey!  This is what I like, see? You come home and your parents                are in your  What are you talkin' about? It's fine, I love having you                here...  Ma, will you stop?  I don't care-- I'm sleeping next door.  No, he's making a bouillabaisse.  So Dad, lemme ask you a question. How many people work at                these big  Yeah, but if you called up and described someone, do you                think they   No, I met someone at this party, and I know where she works,                but I   Nah, the only one I could ask is Elaine, and I can't ask                her.  Because it's complicated-- there's some tension there.  Oh yeah, she's great.  Well, it's a tough thing to talk about... I dunno...  You don't know what it was...  Well, we fight a lot for some reason...  And there was a little problem with the physical chemistry...  Oh, she is, she absolutely is.  No, it's not that. It wasn't all one-sided.  I know, I know...  That's got *nothin'* to do with it.  What are you two talking about? Look, Elaine just wasn't                "the one".  I dunno, maybe...  I can't-- she'll get upset. I never talk about other women                with her,  We're *friends*.  Oh yeah...  I guess...  You mean "stakeout" the lobby?  Y'know what? This is *not* that *bad* an idea...  I dunno. Hard to say.  Loni Anderson.  What, there's something wrong with Loni Anderson?  Hey listen, thanks again for running over here. I appreciate                it.  I'm a little nervous.  If I see her, what do I say that I'm doing here in the building?  What do you do?  You're an *architect*?  I don't see architecture comin from you...  I never said that I was the architect. Just somethin' else...  Well what'dya want me to say, that I just wandered in here?!  What is *his* name?  Bert Harbinson? It sounds made up.  Art Corr...  Corvelay?  Well, what does *he* do?  Just imports, no exports?  No, I guess she's still mad.  Never.  Wait a second... That's her... on the right.  You're you. We're having lunch with Art Corvelay.  Corvelay!  Hey, hey... Pamela's birthday party, didn't I see you there...                This is George. ["Grasps" for her name] I'm sorry...  Ah, Sagman, Bennet, Robbins, Oppenheim and Taft.  Oh, were meeting a friend of ours for lunch. He works here                in the  I don't know. He's an importer.  He's an importer/exporter.  Y'know I'm sorry you had to leave so early the other night.  Oh, that guy was your *cousin*!  Friend!  So, um, do you date immature men?  Ma, will you go already?  What are you doing?!  You can't look in there, we're playing!  Look.  Maybe!  Ma, you can't look up words in the dictionary! Dad, she's                cheating!  Well put *something* down, you're taking twenty minutes                on this.  She said *what*?  She knows! Oh, I am *such* a *jackass*...  She knows the whole stupid thing... Vanessa and the elevator...  Because, Vanessa probably told Pamela, and Pamela probably                told   Yes. *Yes* *I* *am*!  What else did she say on the phone?  Yeah, but what was the tone in her voice? How did she sound?  Yeah, but now I'm nervous.  "Quone"?  "Quone"? No, I'm afraid that I'm going to have                to challenge that.  I am challenging...  Uh-huh...  No good. Sorry. There it is. Get it off...  You must have quite a time down there. [Checks his watch]  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just waiting for someone...  Yeah, yeah...  Yeah, Uncle Mac, you mentioned it...  That's perfect. [Elaine enters] Could you excuse me one                second.   How do you do, Jerry Seinfeld.  Um, do you want to do this now, or do you want to wait until                we get  Alright, the whole elevator business, let me just explain--  No, I'm gonna take my car.  Anyway, you know why I didn't ask you, I mean I felt so                Oh, I'm sorry. Elaine, this is my cousin Artie Levine.  Yeah, "Le*vine*". And I'm Jerry Cougar Mellencamp...                Anyway, I   I mean, if we're gonna be friends, we gotta be able to talk                about  Good.  Good.  Great? Where do you get "great"?  ...Guys.  Uh-huh... Yeah... So, anybody specific?  Oh *really*... Elaine Marie Benes...  No, that's great! That's terrific!  Doesn't matter. What's the young man's name? I would like                to   Well, what does he do? Is he an artisan, a craftsman, a                labourer   Ahh, high finance: bulls... bears... people from Conneticut.  [pause] Alright, sir.  Now that's not fair! So where did you meet this guy?  When you're on a stakeout, do you find it's better to stand                up   Y'know I think that even if you've had a relationship with                someone,  It's              made up. Haagen-Dazs is made up. It's not Danish.  No I'm              not. (to Michael) George. Is Haagen-Dazs Danish?  Danish.              Is it from Denmark?  George?              (walks away to talk privately. George, still casual, taps on Jerry's              shoulder) I don't have a lot of experience with this acting stuff.              But from what I can gather, they're a little touchy about being told              how to say the lines.  I don't              know, but they don't seem to like it. By the way how am I doing?  Why would              he steal a box of raisins?  Nothing.  No.  Are we              going out?  Do you              want me to break up with you?  I don't              even know what you're talking about.  All right.              We're broken up.  Ah! You're              fine. There's nothing wrong with you. I'm the one who's dying.  Because              I can't act! I stink! I don't what I'm doing!  This              show's gonna ruin my entire career. I don't know how I got involved              in this.  This              actress playing Elaine, she's out of her mind.  Why?  You mentioned              the raisins.  Did he              take 'em?  Well              if he didn't take 'em, what happened to 'em?  Hey.  Any luck?  What              about bran?  Well              my friend, (Jerry puts his hand on Kramer's shoulder) it may be time              to consider the dreaded apparatus.  Oh, it's              not that bad!  (to Elaine)              So, you going to the taping tomorrow night?  Oh, come              on you gotta go! He's harmless. He's got a little crush on you.  We need              you there!  Try Elaine.  Just              relax, you'll be fine.  You're              just like George. George'd do the same thing. You're just like him.              It's amazing!  Good              evening, folks. How you doing? (small reaction from the crowd) Well,              you sound like a great crowd. We have a show we're gonna put on for              you tonight. It's a new TV show. It's what they call a pilot. And              we hope it becomes a series. It's called 'Jerry', and I'm playing              Jerry--  Yeah,              it's what John Wilkes Booth yelled out when he shot Lincoln.  It means:              "Death to tyrants".  No, it              starts in five minutes. You were there at the taping, what's the big              deal?  Hey,              what about Russell? Did you hear from him?  Strange.              Even not showing up at the taping...  Well,              well, well.  All right.              Come on sit down. It's about to start.  A wallet?              Let me see that.  Ah, man!              It's my father's wallet! The one he thought they stole at the doctor's              office that time.  How do              you like that?  Hey George.  Yeah.  I like              sneakers.  Nah,              you're crazy anyway.  All right.  Oh yeah.              He's good. You know he's John Ritter's cousin.  Yeah.  Hello,              Charles.  Why don't              you start in the bedroom?  Hey.              The butler's here.  I'm not              sending him to your house.  Because              the judge decreed he'd become my butler, not my friend's butler.  But I              don't want to.  Yeah?  Come              on up.  More              Pledge! I just bought two cans last week and I don't even have any              wood in the house!  What's              all this about?  You had              a date? You went out with my butler? Who said you could go out with              my butler?  Because              he's my butler!  Ever              notice a lot of butlers are named Jeeves?  You know              I think when you name a baby Jeeves, you've pretty much mapped out              his future, wouldn't you say? Not much chance is gonna be a hitman              I think after that. (with a British accent) "Terribly sorry Sir, but              I'm going to have to whack you".  Let's              go out and celebrate! (they all get up)  Come              on let's eat something. (phone rings)  (to the              phone) Hello?  Oh, hi              Rita.  Oh, my              God. Did he get fired?  Russell's              disappeared?  You're              passing already? But the show just ended two minutes ago!  Yeah,              see ya. (he hangs up)  Do you              realize his obsession with you cost us a TV series?  No one              knows.  Hey look              at this. What is going on here?  What              a family!  What?  Hey George, you coming to the Tonight Show on Thursday?  Yeah, sure. My parents will be there.  Yeah, they're in town this week, you wanna go?  No.  No, he's doing mine next. They're low flow you know.  Well, they were humiliated. I mean after the impeachment,                my father  Well, this is the problem. They're moving into this new                development.   No, Leo's not there. He's got a girlfriend, Lydia. In fact,                he moved  Yeah, I know. It devalues the whole thing.  You gotta be there at 4:30.  Yeah, well they tape it in the afternoon and then they air                it at 11:30.  30 years.  All right, I'll see you later.  Yeah, it is.  No economic reason for them to be here.  No social reason for them to be here.  I don't know, maybe get an ice tray?  You know Dad just called me.  Yeah, all right, well I got some people here.  All right, bye. (to Elaine): You see this?

Del Boca Vista, that's where my parents are gonna live!  We could visit together!  That's incredible!  Why?  To spite my parents?  Your parents are crazy!  My parents are moving back too!  You have no idea how your life is gonna improve as a result                of this.   Hello.  Oh, hi dad.  Nothing. A bottle broke. That's all.

For a lot of reasons. And,                I'll tell you reason number one: as an adult, if I want a cookie,                I have  (Trying to read the note)                What have I done? I can't read this! Ful-hel-mo-nen-ter-val? I got                up last night, I wrote this down, I thought I had this great bit.  Johnny? Johnny who? Johnny                Carson? Did I insult Johnny on The Tonight Show?  I don't know. That's like                asking "Where's Waldo?"  I don't think that's it.  What does that mean?  Oh, he's having a heart                attack.  C'mon.  Oh, this is ridiculous.  I know what this is. You                saw that show on PBS last night, Coronary Country. (To Elaine) I                saw it in the TV Guide. I called him and told him to make sure  (To Elaine) He saw that                show on anorexia last year, and ate like an animal for two weeks.  So what do you want? You                want me take you to the hospital?  I'll call an ambulance.                (Exits)  Well? What do you think?  "Salami salami bologna"?  (Sarcastic) What a surprise.                (Enters George's room overly sympathetic - leading George to think                that the Doctor told Jerry something significant) Hey, how  (Still going along with                the practical joke) You know, I was wondering.. You know that Black                Hawks jacket you have?  Well, you know, I was                thinking - if things don't exactly work out..  No, I tried it on. It                fits good.  Well, you know..  Oh, and.. do you think                it would be alright if I called Susan Davis?  Well, it's not like we'd                be bumping into you.  You know, if your future                was a little more certain..  Well, ah.. (Takes his                pillow) What? Kind of like this? (Violently smothers George with                the pillow. George freaks out. He didn't think Jerry would actually  (Acts like he was cought                red-handed) Elaine, what are you doing here? (Takes the pillow off                George, and puts it back on his bed)  (Whispering) There's nothing                wrong with him. I saw the doctor. He's fine.  (Sarcastic) Hey, that                was really fun, George. Can we go home now?  Yeah, if you've been exposed                to gamma rays.  (Sarcastically) Well,                it's like the Capulets and the Montagues.  Women go after doctors                like men go after models. They want someone with knowledge of the                body.. we just want the body.  Hey.  (Trying to shut him up)                Kramer.  Kramer, George didn't                have a heart attack.  (Trying to calm George                down) It's routine surgery.  Well, for one think, don't                listen to him.  Eckman? I thought he was                doing time?  A rebel? No. Johnny Yuma                was a rebel. Eckman is a nut. George, you want to take care of your                tonsils, you do it in a hospital. With a doctor.  George, you need a medical                doctor.  Well, an overnight stay                in a hospital? Minor surgery? I dunno, four grand.  Don't flatter yourself,                my friend. I'm here strictly for material, and I have a feeling                this is a potential gold mine.. I still think you're nuts, though.  (Jokingly making fun of                George) I've never had a really good pickle.  Sorry.  (He thinks this, the audience                can hear his thoughts) And you're not a doctor, but you play one                in real life.  (Again, we hear his thoughts)                There's some hot air blowing in here..  Too much dairy? You really                think I'm eating too much dairy?  I love crampbark.  Cleaver, I once had cleaver                as a kid. I was able to lift a car.  Couchgrass and crampbark?                You know, I think that's what killed Curly.  Excuse me, Tor. May I                ask you a question? You have intuitive abilities. You're in touch                with a lot of this cosmic kind of things.. I have this note I can't                read.  (To Assistant) Maybe he                doesn't like them. That's possible.  (To Assistant) I'll get                you a Chuckle. You want me to get you a Chuckle?  You're gonna fight?  (Pleading) Really, gentlemen,                please.  All this for a Chuckle.  It's a jelly candy. it                comes in five flavors.  You just can't leave him                out there.  How ya doing? (George                nods) Can't talk? (George shakes his head. Jerry gestures to his                brace) Hey, how'd you get the plastic one? (George raises his  Hey, check the TV.  (Pulls the note out of                his pocket) That's it! That's it! Flaming globes of Sigmond! Flaming                Globes of Sigmond! That's my note! tha'ts what I thought was so  I have a friend who's                a hypochondriac, always thinks he's sick - never is. And they, you                have another type of person, always thinks they're well, not matter  ...And it *is* embarrassing, because a doggie bag means                either you  Is that bothering you?  [mockingly] "Please hurry". Look at you. Look                at what you've   Oh, *Carl* can't wait a few more minutes?  He'll like you more...  Yeah, I'm wanting to get married *real* soon...  So, where am I dropping you?  This guy's got quite a racket. I take you to dinner and                then drop  So, is tonight "the night"?  Oooh! Bay-bee *doll*!  Boy, do you smell something?  What is it?  What?  It *can't* be. Nobody has B.O. like this.  But the whole car smells.  So when somebody has B.O., the "O" usually stays                with the "B".   So, this morning I go down to the garage to check the car                out. I  What about skunk?  Horse manure?  Well, I've never seen anything like this in my life. In                fact, I   It means he's lying.  Why? Is that what he told you?  No. Never.  Well, sometimes we do actually have to get up early, but                a man will   Anything's *possible*...  What's the matter with you?  Oh yeah, Steinbrenner...  I know the list...  What smell?  Whatd'ya mean I stink?  I showered! Oh, wait a second... Since I showered, I've                been in   Don't you see what's happening here? It's attached itself                to me!   What happened? My car *stinks* is what happened. And it's                Yeah.  I know... I was at the car wash this morning and the guy                told me   No, no. It's the valet guy.  Oh... No, that's ridiculous.  Suicide, maybe, not lesbianism.  There should be a B.O. squad that patrols the city like                a "Smell   Lemme see if I understand this... On second thought...  Here he is... that's the guy! [rolls up window]  I mean the car *stinks*! George, does the car stink?  Stinks!  Hey, I've never smelled in my *life*, buddy!  That's from the car!  Thank you very much... Well, then go out and smell the car;                You've gotta smell the car  C'mon! One whiff!  Alright, will you pay for the cleaning?  Let's do it.  Wait a minute! It still smells! It still smells!  It still smells!  I don't know!  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do, I'm selling that car!  You don't understand what I'm up against. This is a force                more   Are you crazy? Don't you understand what I'm saying to you?                This  You see! You see what I'm saying to you? It's a presence!                It's   Susan!  What is going on?  That's the *least* of what you've accomplished...  '90.  That's strange...  23 000.  Wait a second... My jacket! I wore that in the car! The                Beast!  This... **thing**... has got to be stopped!  Why do we need B.O.? What is the function of it? Everything                in   Yeah. Are you full?   Here we go... apple pie! Best apple pie in the city.   You're not gonna have any?   Do you not like apple pie?   Well, at least taste it.   You won't even taste it?   Come on, try it!   No. She wouldn't say anything. She just kept shaking her head          like this   No. She carries Entemanns doughnuts in her purse.   The only thing I can think of is I told her we should have those          moving walkways all over the city.   Yeah.   Tell me about it!   They could at least try it.   What's the harm?     Audrey.   Boy, I never broke up with anyone for not tasting pie???   You did?   Boy, I never heard of that happening to a woman?     Keep it.     And you waved it away.   Did you give her a reason?   You were full. So you gave a reason. You didn't just shake your          head.   Exactly. You're not a psycho. You've been very helpful. Thank          you very much. Allow me to leave the tip.   I think you know my policy.   No he's going downtown to guard the suit.   I can't beleive your father owns this place. So how are the desserts          here?   You've tasted them?   Oh I see they have apple pie.   You've had the apple pie?   Audrey, I got to be honest with you. I'm a very curious guy. It's          my nature. I need to know things. Not tasting the apple pie the other          day, I can't get past it. You obviously like pies. You carry doughnuts          in your bag, you're not averse to pastry. Surely you could see how such          a thing would prey on my mind.     Hello Poppie.   The pies. I'm going to the bathroom. You know.   Huh?   No, Nothing.   So she tought I did it to get back at her   I don't think that's the kind of thing you wanna hear about your          father. But I'll tell you when he came out of that bathroom and he was          kneading that dough, it was a wild scene.   Even if you're not gonna soap up, at least pretend for my benefit.          Turn the water on, do something.   You know a chef who doesn't wash is like a cop who steals. It's          a cry for help, he wants to get caught.   We haven't spoken.   Yeah, and Poppie's got problems...   Yeah, all right. Go ahead.   Hum... ok, what else you got?   Oh, because I didn't think the blind guy did it?   Georgio! Nice duds!   Did you hear something?   Yeah.   So what? What would they care?   So you think you're not gonna get the job because your pants make          a noise?   You know, I think all these interviews are making you nuts.   Audrey?   Was it apple?   This woman is bending my mind into a pretzel!   Oh, I got to see this thing.   Boy, the resemblance is uncanny.   Well, I believe there's some legal precedent - Winchell vs. Mahoney,          The Charlie Macarthy hearings.   What are you doing?   Elaine, as your legal counsel I must advise against this.   I don't know about you, but I'm getting a hankering for some doublemint          gum. I'm dropping you off at work, right?   Poppie's   Hello.   So how was the pie?   The apple pie you had today at Monks   Pretty good, wasn'it? I told you you should've tasted it.   Oh, about the... uh   Well, Poppie's a little sloppy.   So you didn't get the job.   Kramer, you can't keep avoiding her like this, you're gonna have          to say something.   Tell her you lost your itch.   Well you should tell her.   No. That's one for the ages. But I think they're gonna put Poppie          away for a long long time.   I was screamin' at hecklers all night. The last time I open                for a rodeo.  Is this the suicide talk or the nickname talk?  You mean like...Liza!  But there's no "t" in your name. What about G-bone?  There's a g-spot.  T-bone, the ladies are gonna love ya.  They heard I opened for Kenny Rogers once.  Oh, I had that comin' to me.   You don't have to whisper. She knows she's a maid.  I hired her from a service!  Thank you. Nice job.  Yeah.  What?  Notice what? She's not really even a maid.  She wants to be an actress...or a, uh, model...or a dancer...or                a...news woman.  You have a girlfriend?  At a rodeo. Where's she moving?  It's like 10 minutes by subway.  That's the new area code. They've run out of 242s, so all                the new numbers are 646.  Here we go.   And a dead bolt.  Well Cindy, the place looks great.  Ok, I'll see ya.  Elaine, do you think I would go willy-nilly into a situation                so obviously fraught with potential complications?  No. I pay her to clean. The rest is--  I was going to say, "Being a good host."  But the point is we have our personal relationship, and                we have our work relationship. They're separate and, I think, some                what sophisticated.  Yes, I do.   Yes, we have.  The store.  Stuff.  And gum.  She's not a maid. She might be a news woman!  Kramer, you're still on the phone?  Really? It's Tuesday here. What day is it there?  Madeline stays here.  Hey, T-bone!  No T-bone?  No! There's no T-bone!  Why no T-bone?  Yes.   No.  Yeah. It's in your closet.  They're behind my skis and my tennis racket.  Where you goin'?  Well, she's here. She just didn't get around to it.  What did I just pay for?  Koko?  Well, it's probably the most intelligent ape there is.  Well, everything's goin' great except, basically, I'm payin'                for sex.  No, George. She's coming over and not cleaning. It's like                I'm seein' a prostitute.  40.  I don't know what this is.  Ooh.  I look about the same.  I was talking to him.  Never mind.  What?  Go back.  I said, never mind.  I hate the counter.  Hey.  Oh, she didn't mind?  Hey, that's great.  Elaine got a new number because she died.  Some new kind of pie.  Hey, there's a booth.  So how's it goin' at work? They get tired of it?  Double zero?  Sounds like he runs a real tight ship.  Good-bye, Koko.  Kramer, maybe this relationship isn't for you.  I didn't hear anything.  Oh, right! Hey, it was great seeing you again. I love your                outfit.  For what?  But you didn't really do any work.  But you took a nap in it.  I thought that was kind of girlfriend bed making.  Well, who took the nap?  $40 seems kind of steep for a nap.  Ho, ho...ho! Hold on. Let's keep this sophisticated.  So is this a breakup/quitting?  Oh, yeah? Well, then, we're through! And you're fired!  So the kid doesn't know his grandmother is dead? G-5?  Miss.  I wouldn't worry about it. B-6?  Elaine...  Hello?  I accept.  Well, what happened?  What's around you?  Is it Famous Ray's?  Famous Original Ray's?  Well, what street are you on?  Just wait there. I'll pick you up, and, Kramer, stay alive                no matter what occurs, I will find you!  Yeah.  Cindy.  You know, she didn't really do what she was supposed to                do.  Hey, come on. Come on. I gotta live around here.  What?  I don't want to make trouble. You want the money? Here.                Nexus of the universe. Hey, Cindy. Cindy.  Here. I got your money.  Come on. Take it. It's money. Let me give it to ya.  Well, this is all very sophisticated.  Look at you. Why don't you use a fork? You're no good with                the sticks.  You stink. You know you stink. What is this?  Oh. Your ballet tickets.  No, but I've seen people on tiptoes.  A beard?  Yes.  Why are you doing this?  Yeah.  Well what about me?  It sounds like an excellent idea.  You can't go wrong with pouty.  Hey, Lou, who's that woman over there?  Yeah, I think I will. I like the idea of having the law                on my side.  And did they suspect anything?  And we discover yet another talent. Posing as a girlfriend                for homosexuals.  You said that already.  Yeah.  Oh no. Don't tell me. You like him?  Yeah, but?  So?  Not conversion. You're thinking conversion?  You think you can get him to just change teams? He's not                going to suddenly switch sides. Forget   Because when you join that team it's not a whim. He likes                his team. He's set with that team.  Yeah, we do. We do have a good team.  They're only comfortable with *their* equipment.  Of course you did. Everyone gets along great when there's    You realize you're venturing into uncharted waters.   Are you that desperate?  So are you going to bring your gun?... All right, then it's                settled. First date, no weapons... All right  What are you looking for?  Sorry. I don't have any tupperware.  What about a plastic bag?  What is the difference?  So did you describe yourself to her over the phone?  What did you say to her?  I don't know.  As you see it?  Did you tell her about, uh, your little hat there?  You know, you're little hair hat there.  Don't you think she could tell?  Are you kidding? I could spot that bird's nest two blocks                away.  Have you noticed people staring at your head?  Well I think you should either take it off or tell her about                it.  Oh, I'll split a cab with you.  Hi Sarge.  What's that?  Oh. Let me ask you, when someone is lying, is it true that                their pants are actually on fire?  Really.  No.  I admit it. I don't watch it.  The poly?  Yes. Melrose Place.  Well I do.  Well maybe I was a little embarrassed.  And Billy and Jake and Allison, yes we could have discussed                it.  The point is I'm going to be taking this lie detector test                and that needle's going to be going wild.  It's too stupid to confess. Look at what I'm confessing                to.  I don't know. Maybe I can beat the machine.  Hey you know what? I have access to one of the most deceitful,                duplicitous, deceptive minds of our  Did you shake it up?  You gotta shake it up.  Yeah, that's a real nuisance. This is killing me.  So tonight are you going to make the move?  Hey there he is. So what happened? Could she detect it?  How so?  She's bald?  Women go bald?  Hey.  Good to have you back.  She's as good as anybody else.  Yeah you've had like a religious awakening. You're like                a bald-again.  So George, how do I beat this lie detector?  Come on, you've got the gift. You're the only one that can                help me.  All right, well I've got to go take this test. I can't believe                I'm doing this.  What?  Get out! (pushes Elaine) How? How did you do that?  Elaine, do you know what you've done? You've give hope to                every woman who's ever said "Too  Jerry Seinfeld.  129 West 81st street.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  (He hesitates) Yes! That stupid idiot. He left her for Kimberly,                he slept with her sister. He tricked  He went back? What do you mean he went back?  I don't understand it. You were having such a great time,                the sex, the shopping.  You can't. That's why they lose very few players.  Well there's always a place for you, on our team.  Yeah. It's coming on in a few minutes.  Hey. Don't worry it hasn't started.  All right, shut up, shut up, Melrose Place is coming on.  Oh that Michael, I hate him, he's just so smug.  I once got Happy new Year in July.  It's pathetic. . . . hey, is it cold out?  Scary cold.  That.  When did you get that?  You like saying Gore-Tex, don't you?  Look at this [start hitting George]  The fabric of society is very complex George.  I'm telling you George, I don't think we want to walk in there          and put a big plastic jug of Pepsi on the table.  You know, you're getting to be an annoying little chore yourself.  You are. I can't get that thing [George] in my car.  Where's the heat in this car? Come on Elaine warm me up, oh! I'm          cold. Give me a squeeze.  You're pretty comfortable up there eh. Bubble boy?  Jerry.  Oh look Elaine, the black and white cookie. I love the black and          white. Two races of flavor living side by side [mumble?] It's a wonderful          thing isn't it?  I'm looking forward to it.  Thank you. All right, look at all this stuff. What are we getting'?          Love that Bobka.  So listen Elaine, when we get up to the door, you , you hold the          cake box.  I don't know, just standing there with a box, holding it by the          little string.  It's a tad dainty.  You see that's not fair. We were here ahead of all these people.  No, forget it.  Well we saw you come in.  Oh so you still don't believe us.  That's the last Bobka. They got the last Bobka.  That was our Bobka.  We should have had that Bobka.  What are we going to do now. If we can't get the Bobka the whole          thing's useless.  Carrot cake? Now why is that a cake? You don't make carrots into          a cake. I'm sorry.  Black Forrest? Too scary. You're in the Forrest, oohh.  How about a Napoleon?   That wa sour Bobka. We had that Bobka!  Another Bobka?  Well, we've got to get the cinnamon.  I beg your pardon? Cinnamon takes a back seat to no Bobka. People          love cinnamon. It should be on tables at restaurants along with salt and          pepper. Anytime anyone says, "Oh This is so good. What's in it?"          The answer invariably comes back, Cinnamon. Cinnamon. Again and again.          Lesser Bobka - I think not.   and a black and white cookie, for me. Peace!  Uhm, The thing about eating the Black and White cookie, Elaine,          is you want to get some black and some white in each bite. Nothing mixes          better than vanilla and chocolate And yet somehow racial harmony eludes          us. If people would only look to the cookie all our problems would be          solved.   Um, um, Look to the cookie Elaine. Look to the cookie.  What?  Oh, take it back. Let's get another one.  No, really, let's get another one. It will just take a second.  Well, I'm not going to eat a cake with a hair on it.  A little hair? Do you think that makes it better?  What if it's your hair?  Who needs misty herbal rain water crap they sell in the health          food store. I use Prell, the hard stuff. A hundred proof - takes your          roots out.  Well, why don't we just forget about the cake?   No, out of the question.  Because I had a bad experience with a hair when I was younger.  I'd rather not talk about it.  All right . . . I once had a hair in my Farina and I freaked out.  Yeah,  I started screaming, "There's a hair in my farina. There's          a hair in my farina." Then I ran out of the house and I was running          and running. I was little but I could run very fast. I just kept running          and they found me like three hours later collapsed at a construction site.  Oh, good.  Ah, that's lovely.  Just what you want to see, yeah. . . . You want to trade your          hair for some phlegm   Uh, wa?  Uh, I don't feel so good.  My stomach, I , I think it was that cookie.  Yeah.  I think I got David Duke and Fahrikan down there.  I feel like I'm going to throw up.  I know, I haven't thrown up since June 29th, 1980.  Fourteen years down the drain.  As good as it gets.  Oh, no thanks.   Hey, what happened to your coat? And what's the smell, what are          you drunk?   What for?  George!  See ya'.  Elaine, see this T-shirts, six years I've had this T-shirts,                it's my   Golden Boy is always the first shirt I wear out of the laundry,                here  But see look at the collar, see it's fraying.

So what do you have to say for yourself?  Why should I have anything for say for myself?  Ha Ha, who told you?  You told Testikov that Tolstoy wanted to name his book "War--                What   Can I take a guess?  Oh I don't know, he threw your organizer out the window?  Because I know who has it.   Because the woman who got hit in the head with it found                my name in   I don't have it!  Because she's not returning it until she gets the money                back for the  How much is Testikov getting from Pendman for this book?  Well that's a start.  You know what room Testikov's in?  Well, you want to get your organizer back don't you?  You know when Super Man saves someone no one asks if he's                trying to  Well you're not Louis Lane.  Ya, are you sure you want to do this.  Ah, here she comes.   Hi, Elaine, this is Corinne.  All right lets go. We'll meet you back here in ten minutes                hopefully  Yes. That's why I where these sneakers, in case of any trouble                and   Oh! Ramscy<?>, great great book if I my say so sir.

No, I just got my laundry back.  He didn't make it.   This is GoldenBoy's son, BabyBlue.  So you didn't ask?  (Points to counter) Counter.  He said wuss?   So you called. (They sit at counter)  Yeah, like a farm boy.  Wow. Enthusiastic 'Hi!', that's beautiful.  Alright, so you're chewing your apple, you got your enthusiastic                And?  Great day in the morning.  Sure, it's like robbing a bank: you don't loiter around                in front of   (In awful Scots/Irish accent) Come on, try it.

I   Oh, I can't begin to tell you how much I hate that commercial.                You like that commercial?  Now wait a second, you mean the one where the guys are all                standing   What could you possibly like about that?  Yeah, they're so funny and so comfortable with each other,                and I   (Shrugs. Pause) Even if the dialogue did ring true. Even                if   But they're talking about nothing.  I know the point.  I mean, all those quick shots of the pants, just pants,                pants,   I'm supposed to see her again on Thursday, but can I go                out with   No kidding. Did you tell him that was the reason?  You're still thinking about this?  She thinks you're a guy that doesn't like coffee.  I don't think so.  Why do we have to leave?  You're kicking me out of my house?  Don't do the apples. That's enough already with the apples.  I'm just gonna get my jacket, I'll meet you downstairs.                What's the   What did you say?  After one date you try and improvise on her machine?  She'll call you back. You're overreacting.  Not once.  I have never seen one episode of 'I Love Lucy' in my life                ever.  Thank you.  Yes, I'm lactose intolerant.  I have no patience for lactose. And I won't stand for it.                Uhm,   What? (To George) What did, what did you say?  Well, so what if I said that?  No, I had to tell my friends, my friends didn't have to                tell you.  I said I couldn't believe you liked that commercial. So                what?  Boy, I bet you got a regular Algonquin round table there.  Oh, Kramer, this is Donna.  Donna, really, you're making too much of this.  Please, Donna.  Don't worry about it, it wasn't working anyway.  I'll tell you later.   You said that?  I can't blame you. I can't believe she never called you                back.  What?  So she didn't get the messages.  But what about the messages?  Elaine's thing? How you gonna get in?  But you know as soon as she gets in the apartment she's                going right   There's nothing to it. You lift the lid, it comes right                out.  What?  How you gonna get me up there?  And who makes the switch?  I do.  I can't get involved in this.  What if she sees me?  A wuss?  Did you call me a wuss?  I got one problem: you're keeping her busy in the other                room. Now,   'Tippy Toe?' I don't think so.  No 'Tippy toe.'  What song?  What is that?  Anything else?  'Lemon Tree'  No, Trini Lopez.  (Produces tapes) Standard. Micro.  Feel good.  Not at all.  All the time.  Hi.  You know, I really need to use the bathroom.

Going to the dog pound, come on  What am I supposed to do? I don't want to do it. I like dogs. I'm not  I'm in the book and I have a machine.  Really? How late are they open?  What?  Yeah, I really think you guys are good together.  I was just trying to be supportive, you know. I knew you were upset.  What are you doing?  Kramer? What did we say that's so bad?  I said, "How come no one's killed her?" Probably shouldn't have said  Okay, Farfel, put your shoes on.  It's not my dog, I don't know where this boozehound is.  I can't let you do that, what about Prognosis Negative?  Well, we'll go see something else tonight. We'll see, uh, Ponce De  She talked me into one more day. Talk amongst yourselves, I'm gonna go  I don't know, regular human time?  Why shouldn't I go here?  Oh yeah, urinals are fun. Can I go?!  So what are calling me six times a day?  I could read the sports section if my hair was on fire.  It is? Oh yeah, you're right. What else is playing?  Boy, I know she really wants to see that with me.  I don't know what to do.  I know, I know.  It is kind of silly.  I mean, it's just a movie, for god's sake.  It's not like she's *in* the movie.  Am I supposed to ruin the whole night because she wants to see it? I  How does sitting next to a person in a movie theater increase the level  Saving movies.  Two for Prognosis Negative. I'm in trouble.  You know it's interesting, because I called the hospital and they said  Oh, hi Ellen.  Listen, it's really been a pleasure taking care of your dog for a week,  Prediction. I never see you or him again for the rest of my life.  Why don't we just rent a movie?  No, it's supposed to be really bad, *really* bad. I mean it's long,  Well, George told me the whole story, line for line, I mean I almost  You and George got together?  Hello.  What's up?  About what?  Too bad.  Prognosis Negative.  It's not.  I have an instinct for these things.  Why would anyone eat canned fruit? I mean can anybody answer                that?  I can see the can if you're in the army, but fresh fruit                it's available, it's  Where you going?  Discount?  So ah, what did you do last night?  I know nothing, but what did you actually do?  Wow. That really is nothing.  Hey.  What are you all dressed up for?  Oh yeah, how's that looking?  Frankly I'm surprised you're so litigious.  Hi Bob.  (Apologetically) Oh, I'm sorry. Maestro.  I hear it's ah beautiful there.  (Surprised) Huh?  This is a, Bob Cobb.  Oh what, because I didn't call him Maestro?  Ya know I feel a little funny calling somebody Maestro.  Because it's a stupid thing to be called.  Oh conductor. He conducts the Policeman's Benevolent Association                Orchestra.  Well he sure worked pretty fast with Elaine.  New shirt?  No, not particularly.  Yeah.   Yeah, it's burning my retina. Susan picked that out for                you right?  (Reaches for a menu) All right what's it going to be here.  No.  Are you sensing anything right now?  Well, what about criminal activity? He's got to be alert.  Maybe they offered him a chair and he turned it down.  I know you will.  His lawyer.  What?  Why are they settling?  All this because you spilled coffee on yourself?  What do you mean?  So?  I thought they wanted to settle.  Then you're in a lot of trouble.  Did you have a good time?  (Sarcastically) Yeah, everyone knows that, it was in Amadeus.  So what about the "Maestro" stuff. Did he make                you call him Maestro.  You didn't mind?  O.K. from now on I want you to call me "Jerry the Great".  Why not you call him Maestro.  Well, I'm great.  What about his house in Tuscany, he mention that?  You know when I told him it was beautiful there, out of                the clear blue sky  I don't know. Maybe he's embarrassed by Americans.  In all of Tuscany? I wonder.  Hey you know we were just talking about you.  Yeah, ya know the other day how you mentioned that there                were no houses   No. I'm not really looking.  So are you telling me there's not one house to rent in all                of Tuscany?  I can't get a sublet, a guest room, a cot, nothing?  How'd you get yours?  Maybe I'll check out France.  Hey George, do you believe this guy?  Bob Cobb.  You know, the Maestro.  Yeah, get this, he tells me there are no houses any where                in Tuscany to rent.  No.  I just wish I could figure out if this guy is trying to                keep me out of   I have no idea.  Oh, no way it's that big.  Do you know how big North Dakota is stupid?  Hey, no one's got a gun to your head.  Yeah and?  So are you gonna get him a chair?  Yeah, that would give him some height, be able to check                things out. With a  Swivel?  I thinks it's kind of a pompous look. You know my parents                used to have a   Yes.  How can I figure out if there's any places to rent in Tuscany?                Wait a   Poppy told me to talk to his cousin, he lives down in Little                Italy.  Hey hey hey, slow down Eddie. What what's the matter?  That's it?  You've got to stop it. Your your all hopped up on the caffein.  You're racing!  Ah, excuse me, I'm looking for a Mr. Giggio.  Poppy sent me to see you Mr. Giggio.  Um, did he did he mention to you why I called?  Yeah, right, right. So is there anything there to rent?  I didn't actually want to rent it.  So see um, I didn't say that I wanted to rent it, I was                just wondering if  You didn't have to push me.  75,000 lira.  Kramer you don't under the conversion rate.  You know I don't even know why I brought you.  Not bad!  So I move into the centre lane, now I get ahead of this  Is that it?

Wait, you left the lock open or the door open?  The door? You left the door open?  Yeah, and?  So the door was wide open?  [Elaine enters the living-room] And where were you?

[to George] Is that uh, other apartment still  I got ripped off for about the...18th time? And now,  How do you get all that wood in here?  They deliver wood?  Whatta ya tip a "wood guy"?  Would I have to get a gardener?  You tip him?  They deliver the coal?  Oh, than I gotta tip him.  I don't have any plants.  [closes the closet with Elaine still in it]...I like  [walks around with Elaine walking next to him, copying  You like the couch? I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do.

You could take it? You want it?  So you do want it.  You just said, you wanted it!  [picks up the lease and hands it to George] So take it.  How can I take it?  How can I want it now, if you want it?  I...am not taking it. [drops the lease demonstratively]  Well, whatta you wanna do here?  Do you wanna flip a coin?  OK, fine...[takes a coin from his pocket] This is the  All right, now you call it in the air.  No no.  Tails!  So what?  You didn't call no interference!  I don't believe this.  I don't wanna win it like this! Elaine, what do ya  ...Well, I'll tell ya what: I'll choose you for it.  Odds  Good.  For the apartment. [they take their "choose positions"]  Mine!  Mine! [George walks to the table to take a break]  Thanks. [George walks to the bathroom]  Yeah.  Hard to imagine. [ironically]  Right.  Ooh, case closed!

[very  If only the coin hadn't hit the table.  It is not!  It's wonderful. [idem; they sit down again]  How late are the stores open? I'm thinking of maybe uh,  Professional tennis. To me I don't understand all the shushing.                Why are they always shushing. Shh, shh. Don't the players know that                we're there? Should we duck down behind the seats so they don't                see us watching them? Tennis is basically just ping-pong and the                players are standing on the table. That's all it is. And that goofy                scoring, you win one point and all the sudden you're up by 15. Two                points, 30-love. 30-love. Sounds like an English call girl. "That'll                be 30, love... And could you be a little quieter next time, please,                shh."  Are these seats unbelievable or what?  Here.  What, are you on Mercury?  You got a problem with paba?  You don't even know what paba is.  I'll go if someone else drives. You going?  You're bringing a date to a party?  A party is a bad date situation. It doesn't matter who you're                with. You could be with J. Edgar Hoover. You don't want to sit and                talk with Hoover all night. You want to circulate. (Makes hand motions)                Ho, ho, ho.  Well I would think, with the law enforcement and the cross                dressing. Seems like an interesting guy.  That woman is absolutely stunning.  Not the Croat, the lineswoman. That is the most beautiful                lineswoman I've ever seen.  B.L.?  I can't take my eyes off that lineswoman. That lineswoman                is absolutely mesmerizing.  I gotta talk to her. What do you think?  I'm going to psyche myself into it like those people that                just walk across the hot coals.  I have to. I won't be able to live with myself.  I can't.  I don't know, "Hi".  Excuse me. (Woman ignores him) Excuse me? (Still ignores                him) Oh that's nice. That's right ignore me. That's real polite.                Nobody's even talking to you. All you big lineswoman. Oh you've                got some kind of a cool job. I know your type thinking your too                good for everyone, but it's women like you (woman turns around and                notices him) oh well, what are you deaf?  I'm not *saying* she's deaf, she's deaf.  Can't hear a thing.  Yeah, isn't that something?  Really?  I met this deaf lineswoman at the tennis match.  Wow good plan.  That's nice.  That's nice for the freaks.  Why don't you get him some tickets or something, how about                that friend of yours that works at the ticket area.  Kramer, I think perhaps you've overlooked one of the key                aspects of this activity. It's ball *boys*, not ball men. There                are no ball men.  All right I'll talk to her. If you want to be a ball man                go ahead, break the ball barrier.  But I thought things were going great.  Did she say why?  But that's your routine.  So she sees you with hot fudge on your face and she ends                it? You really think she would be that superficial?  Hello... Oh hi dad... You saw him?... Really with the ice                cream?... All right I'll talk to you later, bye.   Yeah.  He thinks Gwen broke up with him because she saw him eating                the ice cream on TV.  Well if a couple breaks up and have plans to go to a neutral                place, who withdraws? What's the ettiquite?   I think she should withdraw. She's the breaker, he's the                breakee. He needs to get on with his life.  Really.  Well I don't care, I don't want to go anyway. I don't want                to fight that traffic on Friday night.  Really?  Okay.  Oh I got a date with Laura the lineswoman.  Why? (George fiddles with the lock on the door.) Well what                are you doing?  Oh, uh, do you want to come with us?  Let's get the check. (Waves in the air) Is this considered                signing? Do you do this when you want the check? Really. I know                a sign, that's my first sign.  She reads lips.  (Puts his hand over his mouth) What?  (Holds his drink up to his mouth) She's not a novelty act,                George. Where you hire her out for weddings and bar mitzvas.  (Puts his napkin over his mouth) I don't know George. I'm                not sure about this.  (Puts his hand on his chin over his mouth) All right.  Uh Laura, George was wondering if...  So I really had a good time.  So you want to go to the party on Friday night?  All right, we're taking a car service. So we'll swing by                and pick you up. How about six? (Laura looks offended). Six is good.                (Laura looks offended and angry). You got a problem with six? (Laura                opens the door and gets out). What? What?   See I was saying "six" but she thought I was saying                "sex". We straightened the whole thing out though.  Yeah.  Well "six" and "sex" are close.  Eh.  Well I'm not dating any other deaf women.  You're kidding.  In five minutes. He's then going to pick us up, then we're                going to pick up Elaine, and Laura is going to meet us there.  I know. It's like X-ray vision.  Can't do it Newman.  Not going to happen.  Oh just pull over right there by the stop sign.  I said pull over by the stop sign.  ca.  You know the whole idea of taking the car service was so                I wouldn't have to fight the traffic on Friday night.  I know. I'm late. Hey now I know two signs, (puts his hand                in the air) check, and (points to his watch) late. Hey this is the                guy you helped become the first ball man.  Hi tide?  No. If I lend her to you I'll have to lend her to everybody.  I know and on the first tournament of her comeback.  Thus ends the great ball man experiment.  This is amazing, I haven't seen one guy going in to that restaurant          since it opened. Poor guy.   What's that smell? What are you wearing?   Manly.   So why didn't you say no?   Poor guy. His family is probably in Pakistan waiting him to send          back money. This is horrible.   That's because you're stupid enough to wear the cologne.   I've never been a guinea pig. I've been a sheep, a tody.   All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead, you're taking the IQ test.   Who thinks you're smart?   What thing?   Oh, the IQ thing...yeah.   What did you get?   What do you say?   1409, that's a good score.   What did you really get?   Of course.   I hope so.   He's serving Mexican ,Italian, Chinese. He's all over the place.          That's why no one is going in.   I don't know, I'm obsessed with it. It's like a spider in the          toilet struggling for a survival. And even if you know it's not going          to make it, you kind of root it for awhile.   Well, it's a spider.   Bazooka Joe.   The buzzer.   My house? You have to be on the lease to press to buzzer. Yeah?          Come on up.   What's that?   Go in, go in!   No, I'm afraid if we start talking, I'm gonna wind up going partners          with him.   You know, I could probably shoot him from here. I'd be doing us          both a favor.   Casus belli.   Hey, how did you do on that IQ test?   Oh, it's nothing...   Why must you always be the vocal point of attention? Why can't          you just be? Why can't you live?   This woman he's dating is making him to take this IQ test for          this course.   No see, he's not smart. People think he's smart, but he's not.          You know, I don't even know my IQ.   Get out of here!   You get out of here!   Well, that would be something, cheating on a IQ test. Hey, remember          in college when you passed Lettick the test out the window? You became          a legend after that.   Take it to Dream Cafe, you won't hear a peep.   Hey, I love a good caper.   Well, I've been looking forward to it.   Eh, people, people are talking.   Non smoking would be great.   Thank you. [Throws the towel around like a hot potato.]   Well, what do you recommend my good fellow?   Oh, the turkey it'll be. And may I say you have a splendid establishment          here , my friend. I'm sure you flourish in this location for many many          years.   Thank you Babu. You have quite a flair. You are quite the restaurateur          I must say.   Oh, please...   Eat something! Babu...   Oh wow, so you got the test. You're cheating.   Hey.   So?   Why not?   Statute.   Statute of limitations. It's not a statue.   Fine, it's a sculpture of limitations.   Go ahead, I'll take care of it.   It's all right, she was cheating anyway.   Babu, you're Pakistani?   Babu, may I say something?   I'm not a restaurateur by any means, but it occurred to me that          perhaps you might serve some dishes from your native Pakistan? As opposed          to franks and beans for example.   Doesn't matter. You would have the only authentic Pakistani restaurant          in the whole neighborhood.   Well, not everything. I do what I can.   Most people in a situation like this, they walk right by it. Not          me.   Of course, I always do.   Hey Georgie!   How did you do on the IQ test?!   What?!!   Well, well, well...   Well, I'm no genius, but according to my calculations he should          be here in a few seconds.   Well, maybe the test was gender bias, you know a lot of questions          about hunting and testicles...   But an 85?   Take it here, I'll leave, there'll be no distractions.   Well, congratulations my friend. You know, I sorry I missed the          grand re-opening. I was out of town for about a week.   I think it's fantastic. Has a certain indefinable charm.   Let me tell you something Babu. You go back there in that kitchen          and tell your chef I want the works.   Babu? Babu...[waves Babu to come to table] Babu...you know, I          got to tell you, I never do this, but the shrimp, it's just that it's          a little stringy. You have any chicken?   Well, maybe your refrigerator...   You know, I think I'll just take the check.   You know what it was, bad location.   Aren't you cold? Where's your jacket?   Oh, I'm sorry.   151?   So, what are you up for? How about Mexican?   You know, what would be great?   I had a very interesting lunch with George: Costanza today.  (to Elaine) I can't believe you write for this J.Peterman                catalog.  I thought that new promotion was supposed to be a lot more                work.  How do you pull that off?  Yeah, he looks busy! Yeah!  So did you come up with a little stupid story for the Himalayan                walking shoe yet?  What marathon runner?  Oh, wait! Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul! Isn't he the guy who overslept                at the Olympics 4 years ago  He's from uh...Trinidad and Tobago, right?  How do you oversleep at the Olympics...?  I mean, it's like the biggest event of your life! You'd                think you'd have, like, 6 alarm  Ah...that's a big responsability on your hands.  You gotta wake him up!  I've seen her in your building.  I didn't know she was married.  Whom I gonna tell?  He overslept and missed the whole race. Isn't that amazing?  My money's on the snooze. I bet he hit the snooze for an                extra 5 and it never came back  What do you do?  Always works?  Hot tub?  Isn't that the same temperature the coffee that scalded                you?  I don't ask those kind of questions anymore.  Ah, hi Jean-Paul. Nice to meet you.  Sorry about the Olympics.  Ah...catalog writer's block?  (pause) So what happened? The snooze alarm, wasn't it?  AM/PM.  Ah...the volume.  Ah, separate knob.  Some people like to have the radio alarm a little louder                than the radio.   Don't worry, it's not gonna happen again. Not if I have                anything to say about it.  Elaine, what's the alarm clock situation in your house?  It's a simple question...  That old one? Didn't I once miss a flight to Cleveland because                of that alarm clock?  Elaine...  You're 40 minutes late. What happened?  No.  Well, you said you were gonna be here at a certain time,                and you weren't.  Well, means that a man has come from very far away to compete                in a very difficult race,  Yes I am.  Yeah, I know that!  I'm not talking about upside down. (Jean-Paul and Kramer                come in) I'm talking about waking  Hey, Jean-Paul. How was your soak? Was a good soak?  What happened?  Yeah. I hope so ?!  Kramer, I'm tellin' you, Elaine doesn't know whatta hell                she's doin'! I gotta take over  I'm not taking a soak in that human bacteria frat you got                goin' there.  Jean-Paul, I asked you down here this morning because I'm                concerned. Concerned that  I'm saying "get the hell outta there"! Let me                put you in a hotel. You'll be comfortable,   These people never fail. They sit in a room with a big clock                all night long, just waitin'  Hey, how was the meeting?  Sons of bitches?  How many sweaters you got on?  Your core temperature?  Oh whatta hell is goin'on?!  Turn up the heat in your apartment! (opens a window)  Hello?...yeah, I can be there in 10 minutes...you can count                on me! (hangs up)  I got the call...!  (stops walking) Jean-Paul! (George acts like he scored)  Pretty lucky to find this hotel, Jean-Paul.   All right. (picks up the alarm clock) Let's check out the                clock. Notch good... 6:50...  How about adult contemporary?  All right...we're going with adult contempo... (puts alarm                away, gets phone) now...  Yeah, this is room 419, I'd like a wake-up call for 6:50                AM tomorrow morning.  That's room 419. 6:50 AM. Four...one...niner...  I know, but it's a very important wake-up call... and I                don't wanna take any chances.  Well, I just...don't wanna get into a whole thing with you                here...  ...Yeah I am, but I just...(man hangs-up)  humm...  I think I offended the wake-up guy...! (worried)  (gets up) No, no, I did. I think he's got it in for me!  What if he doesn't call now out of spite?  (pause) Not comfortable... (gets up again)  Feel much better here at my home base, Jean-Paul. It's a                controlled environment.  Hey, believe me, if I'd been with you there in Barcelona...you'd                be polishing that medal  That wake-up guy was trouble! All right, I'll be right back.                (goes knocking on Kramer's)  (shouting) Man that thing is noisy!  Yeah, listen, do me a favor. Set your mental alarm for 6:30                and gimme a call.  He's put his faith in you. He's put his faith in you.  Frankly, I'm a little concerned.  4:02? (Checks his wristwatch) Aaa-aaahhh! Eight forty seven                Jean-Paul! Wake up! Wake uuuuup!  Come on, just put your clothes on! You'll get dressed in                the car!  Kramer, what happened to the building?! The electricity                went out!  What happened to your mental alarm?!  Make way! I've got-I've got a runner here! Get outta the                way! Make way! Make way!  All right, go, it's a race! Come on!  I'm tellin'you, I never told anyone about that baby. I never                even went near your building!   Maybe you should check with the rabbi.  Come on, let's go Jean-Paul!  "Jimmy"  "I dunno how you could forget . He kept reffering to                himself in the   "Why. You took a shower?"  "Aw right."  "No...Got dental appointment."  "Yeah!"  "Oh! How d'you like that?"  "I think that's eat 24 hours before surgery."  "All right."  "The Velvet fog?"  "What the hell his a velvet fog."  "Well , where is it?."  "AMCA?"  "Naaaaaa...I can't watch a man sing a song."  "They get all emotional , they sway. It's embarrassing."  "I don't think so."  (interrupting) "Elaine , I really don't...............pay                much   "No... I find them repugnant and unappealing."  (pointing Kramer) "To wit"  "No ,Elaine and I we're just discussing whether I could                admit a man   "Really!"  "Just one....gotta go back.....Oh but get this. Elaine,                you will   "Yeah!!! What is that? I mean isn't that sick. I mean                , I'd be   (outraged) He's a doctor!.I mean it's supposed to be like                a sterile   "Of course.... But that's got nothing to do with it."  "What are you doing that for, you got a job"  " Yeah! What's that."  "Jimmy's got a record. Jimmy's jumping for dollars.                Jimmt and George   "Kom Pau(sp?"  "Ahh! You too with these?"  "So what did Tim say?"  "Looks like he gave you some Novocaine"  "So what about the Penthouse. Did you ask him?"  "Adults only?"  "What the hell's going on over there?"  "You find you need to use a lot of obscenities at the                dentist.  "Hey! Hey! Watch it.!... You're drooling all over the                floor. How   "Why are you taking this so personally?"  "What about the Velvet Fog ?"  "Wait a second ..Where you wearing those shoes in the                cab?"  "Don't you see what's happened, he couldn't talk ,                he's wearing   "Well...........you know....."  "Not necessarily because....."  "Oh! where's Jennifer today?"  "I don't think so. I think they were getting dressed                and not only   "I think so."  "You know! Like a tennis shirt."  "Sometimes I tuck'em sometimes I don't"  "I think I was tucked.!"  "I don't know but I was spitting out and rinsing like                there was no   "Is this guy a dentist or Caligula?"  "I don't think I'm hungry:"  " But I'm damaged goods now."  "Hey, by the way, did you ever call that guy from the                health club.?"  "Jimmy?  "That's the guy?"  "Can't believe your going out with him..."  "I dunno. He's so strange.'  "Did you notice he always refer to himself in the third                person.   "That's Jimmy. That's the way he talks."  "Jimmy's gonna put the moves on Elaine.."  "Why?"  "I don't know how you can eat that spicy chicken,"  "What's that?"  "No no you said George likes spicy chicken."  "You're turning in to Jimmy."  "Where's my Mr. Goodbar?"  Now, I was thinking the other day about hair, and that the weird          I would think.  (scoffs) You don't flamenco on the first date.  Yeah? Would you do it?  Well, I knew you'd have an affinity for it, because it's the   Hello. (listens) Oh, hi Nana. (listens) What? Oh. Oh, alright,          I have to go over to my grandmother's.  I have to open a bottle of ketchup for her.  No, we have time.  Ah, she's starting to slip a little. Sometimes she has   Like toothpaste?  There's a squeeze ketchup.  Well, if they make squeeze mustard, doesn't it stand to reason          I really don't see the difference.  It's subtle.  (looking ahead) Yeah, there she is. Uh-oh.  Ah, she's with her friend Wendy.  Yeah. I'm on a kiss hello program with her.  Yeah. Every time I see her, I gotta kiss her hello. I just did          Ah, that's fortunate. I really admire that.  No, I told you I admire your hearing.  No, don't slough that off, you have great hearing.  Bye.  (adamant) Well, I'm going on record right now that that was my          Well, you know, frankly, outside of a sexual relationship, I   (to Elaine) And what's with that hairdo, by the way?  She looks like something out of an old high school yearbook. You    Yeah. Kramer's the only person who could say something like   What you have to do is introduce him, and then he'll just come          Speak of the devil.  What for?  Why?  (reluctant) I, I don't want my picture plastered up in the   (still reluctant) Kramer, I don't wanna stop and talk with   Hello, uncle Leo!  Nana called me to open the ketchup bottle.  Hi Nana.  Yes. (kisses Nana) Yes of course.  (also grabbing) What're you doing, I got it.  Will you stop it.  Uncle Leo! (releasing his grip) Alright! Take it!  I'm just not getting any hot water.  Thanks, Julio.  Huh?  What's going on here?  (suspicious) Well, then what're you doing?  What for?  (accusingly) You're looking for a picture of me, aren't you?  I told you, forget it.  You're robbing me.  (removing his coat) So? Are you sure Wendy's coming?  Well, this'll be a very interesting experiment to see if Kramer          Hello. Oh, hi mom. Yeah, I was at Nana's yesterday. I had to   Yeah?  Come on up.  No no, he'll come in. Well, this is gonna be my first   It's the obligation, you know? As soon as this person comes in,          Elaine, now you're being ridiculous.  (muffled) Hi Wendy.  (muffled) Would you like something to drink?  (muffled) There you go.  Oh, look at that. I'm almost outta Klondike bars.  So, how's everything going?  Oh, yeah, he had to take his mother to the chiropodist.  C'mon, that's not fair!  No, c'mon Kramer. (crossing to Kramer) Gimme that picture.  (throws up his hands) Alright, fine. Put my picture up. What do          Oh my god! Look at that picture, it's terrible...  ...You can't put that picture up.  Oh. Hello, uh (looks for and finds the photo) Mary.  (not really) Yeah.  Oh, sure, yeah.  Oh, no!  You see? That's just what I need. More kissing!  What is so funny?  Hello. Oh, hi mom. (listens) What? Oh my... He didn't?! He   (aghast) Uncle Leo put Nana in a home!  (suspicious) I don't know. Maybe to keep her quiet.  (not as eager) Hi Joan.  Pretty good.  Okay, great.  Oh, I'm delighted.  You too.  Hi, Louise.  Ah, well. Thank you very much!  (agitated) For putting my picture up on that wall! I'm like   Family?  You think I want another family? My father's demanding my uncle          Yes, it's very strange. Very strange.  I tell you. If you were hitch-hiking, you'd never get into a car          You should have her work on it for you.  Hi Mary.  Uh, listen. I decided I can't kiss hello anymore. I'm sorry.   ...It just makes me a little uncomfortable and I can't do it.          Hi Louise...  ...I was just telling Mary how I'm not gonna be doing the kiss          (as the elevator doors close) Thank you for your cooperation.  Hello.  Hi mom. So, what's happening with uncle Leo? Is he paying you?  Okay, I will.  (locking his door) Oh, I gotta go visit my nana in the nursing          Hey, Kramer, look at this.  Look at my picture!  I've been defaced!  Hi Jack.  Hey, Julio. I was wondering, could you get to that shower today,          (defensive) No no, that's not true!  You know, she really doesn't belong here. My uncle put her here,          Buddy?  So you were with him that day at the track?  Leo?  Is that so?  Well, that's very interesting.  (standing) Uncle Leo! I just met an old acquaintance of yours.          (with a triumphant point) You're busted!  Hey, Steve. How you doing?  Hey, Jeff. What's happening?  Mary! Oh, Mary! Give us a kiss.  Don't be like that, Mary. C'mon, I made a mistake!  Oh, Paul, could you hold that door...  Hey. Could I use your shower?  (pleading) I got a date. C'mon, please.  (impressed) Who's that?  Oh man. Looks like you got quite a few people here.  (rueful acceptance) Oh, yeah, I understand.  Men flip around the television more than women, I think.                Men get that remote control in their hands, they don't even know                what the hell they're watching.  She's the performance artist, right?  What's her husband's name, again? Chip? Kip? Skip?  Todd. Oh yeah. (To George) He's a Kennedy.  C'mon. He's a third cousin, or something.  Oh, by marriage. (To George) We went to their wedding. You                should have heard him talking about Chappaquiddick - trying to blame                the whole thing on  Thin ice, George. Thin ice..  (Gesturing to George) You believe this guy? He holds a grudge                like Khomeini.  Oh, and she cooks dinner onstage for some celebrity?  (To Elaine) he thought he still had a shot.  What ever happened with the shirt?  Asked you? You're not going to do that are you?  Ask not what I can do for you - ask what you can do for                me.  But?  Lyme disease? I thought she had Epstein-Barr Syndrome?  How did she get Lyme disease?  They still do that play?  With all the nudity?  Explain to me how this baby shower thing works.  Well, I mean, does it ever erupt into a drunken orgy of                violence?  There's no hazing of the fetus, or anything, is there?  When is this suppose to be?  Saturday?.. Well, I have a show in Buffalo on Saturday.                They're not gonna bust up my apartment, or anything, are they?  'Cause I've seen these pregnant women - and they sometimes                misjudge their fetal girth. Just like one wrong turn, and boom!                And entire buffet is swept off  And if you do?  Quiet. I'm trying to get a picture.  (Pleading) Leave me alone.  I'm not getting illegal cable!  No, I read in the paper..  Well, they might hook us up again.  Stop shouting! You're ruining the reception.  What you're suggesting is illegal.  It's against the law.  (Gesturing to the rabbit ears) Just, just, hold this. Can                you hold that?  A real human rights nut, huh?  I don't know. What if I get caught?  You know, why don't we wait? Because, I'm going out of town                tomarrow.  (Mutters to himself) Every time I turn on the TV, sirens                are gonna go off. They're gonna track me down like a dog, I know                it..  (Pauses, thinking about what Kramer just said) Put it in.  Seinfeld.  My cable hook-up? What about it?  It has? I've been out of town. How did you know?  Wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on! We're just patsies.                We're just a couple of users.. We never sold the stuff. What about                the Russian guy? The Russian  Excuse me. Can I get something to drink?  What's with this airline? What are you, cutting out the                drinks now?  (Sarcastic) Are they gonna go over the instructions again?  I'm not afraid of flying, although many people do have fear                of flying and, I have no arguement with that. I think fear of flying                is quite rational because, human  Oh, fire engines, ambulances all along the runway. And then,                when we landed safely, they all seemed so disappointed.  Well, there was so much snow. The roads were closed. I really                appreciate it - you picking me up. Thanks again.  No, really.. an airport run.  Hey, it's one thing if I asked you "Could you do me                a favor?" ..But to suggest it?.. GEORGE: (Obviously up to something.                Jerry doesn't suspect anything -  (Joking) You know, if Richie Brandes did this, I'd be suspicious,                you know. He's always got some ulterior motive.  Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't take the bridge..                Get off here. We can't go back to my place, Elaine's having the                shower.  Yeah, yeah. I forgot all about it. Alright, it's no big              deal. We'll just go back to your place.  You want to get a bite?  Well, so what should we do?  Red shirt! Red shirt! That's the red shirt!  You're wearing the chocolate shirt!  A - Ha! Nice try, my friend, but you gotta get up pretty                early in the morning..  What are you gonna do? Badger a pregnant woman at her own                baby shower?! What are you, gonna take it off and make her rinse                it in club soda?  And what if we go up there? What are you going to say to                her?  Yeah.  You'll never say that to her face.  The show was cancelled. There was a blizzard.  Well, Leslie, sometimes the road less travelled is less                travelled for a reason.  I'm sorry, I..  (Stammering) Oh, I, I, think I remember..  Well, I'm sure I meant to call.. I probably just lost your..  No, I don't think that..  Alright, listen, I've changed my mind about this whole thing.                I don't want cable.  No, I don't want. So, just tell me what I owe you for your                trouble..  (To Kramer) Four hundred dollars?1 You told me one-fifty!  (Defiantly) I'm not paying four hundred dollars! I don't                even want the thing. What are you going to do?!  Alright, I said I had a good time and I'd call, but who                takes that literally?  What do you do at the end of a date when you know you don't                want to see this person ever again, for the rest of your life? What                do you say? What do you  Why did you give him MY number?  I wonder if any woman ever said that about Einstein?  Call me when the pencil comes in Okay?  Why does Mr. Pitt prefer a pencil to a pen anyway? Hey. Look who's          here.  Hi Julie.  Just had a big bowl of Kix.  Big lettuce, big carrots, tomatoes like volleyballs.  Dating is really starting to get embarrassing isn't it?  People on dates shouldn't even be allowed out in public.  It's embarrassing for them. It's painful for us to watch. I'm          going out with someone later, I'm not even taking her out of the house.  I don't need a bunch of people staring at us.  What was that?  Certainly are.   All right. You're in MY face.  [on phone] Hello. No she's not here. Okay, fine, whatever. I'll          tell her. Okay. Goodbye. The stationery store guy called to say he ORDERED          your pencil.   He doesn't even care if a man answers.  Bye bye  Well, that all depends. . .   Yeah, so?  Is that a fact?  No it isn't.   Yes you did.  She could have.  Imagine, her taking credit for your big salad.   Obviously.  What?  Well, generally speaking you don't need any extra incentive to          murder a dry cleaner. I wouldn't worry about that.   And Kramer thinks a penalty stroke may have driven him to it.  Ah, no , I don't think so.  We don't need a bunch of people staring at us.  Hello. No she's not here. Yes I will tell her. No I don't know          what time she might be coming back. Look I gotta' go. Goodbye. . . . That,          that's a long story.   Hello Newman.  No, no I don't. Why?  I suppose.  I don't know. Nothing.?   You two know each other?  . . . YOU went out with . . . Newman?  Why?  You liked, Newman?  No, I'm sorry. I'm just a little curious. I mean why did you stop          seeing him.   . . . HE ended it?   No, no of course not.   What tee?  Newman! She went out with Newman!  No. It isn't and the most distressing part of it is, not that          she went out with him but that HE stopped seeing her. Do you understand?          He, Newman; Newman stopped seeing her. Newman never stopped seeing anybody.          Newman will see whoever is willing to see him. Not so much why she did          see him as disturbing as that is. But why, did HE, Newman, stop seeing          her?   No, there's less.   No it isn't. I've looked into his eyes. He's pure evil.   Yeah, he's a mystery wrapped in a Twinkie.  No,, but thank you.   Oh, by the way, your stationery store guy called and he's got          your pencil.   No, he left the store early, made a special trip to the distributor          and got it.   Well, what did you do that for? You ordered it.  Well, you better go down there and tell this guy. He's very excited.          Hi Julie.  Hi.   Hi, how are you, Elaine? I'm meeting George here.   How do you know THAT?  It's Jerry.  Come on Newman. OPEN THE DOOR!  Okay, pudgy, lets stop playing games. What happened with margaret?  No, we can't. My skin is crawling just being inside your little          rat's nest. Now, what happened?  Noit your type?   Well, how come?   What, what is wrong with her?   You don't think she's attractive?  Okay, Newman, thanks a lot.   No, thank you.   But it's just a friendly game. Why do you have to be such a stickler?  What are you so worried about this for?  He did?  So it had nothing to do with you.   No, I don't think so.   Hey, let me ask you a question. You met margaret. Doo you think          Margaret's good looking? Um, she's a natural beauty. Oh, no makeup. I          like that.   Yeah, and the curls. You like the curls?  Yeah,, me too.   Where you going?  You're going to see Genderson?  You had how many dates with him? Three?   And . .   What? I'm not looking. Nothing.   Why are you looking at my face?   Where am I going to look?   . . . I can't.   Newman!  All I could think of was when I was looking at her face was; Newman          found this unacceptable.   You're going out with the stationery store guy?  Hello, what? You're kidding. I'm turning it on. Oh, my god. Get          out of here. [hangs up] Hey listen to this. They issued a warrant for          Genderson's arrest. He escaped and the police spotted him on the New Jersey          Turnpike.   I have never seen an old person in a new bathing suit in my life.          I don't know where they get their bathing suits, but my father has bathing          suits from other centuries. My parents live in Florida, and if you go          down there and you forget your bathing suits then they want you to wear          one of theirs. You know how that gets? "You need trunks son? I've          got trunks for you. You can wear my trunks." Fathers don't wear bathing          suits, they wear trunks. It's kind of the same thing a tree would wear          if it went swimming. So I get in the water with in thing and it's like          floating around me somewhere. Did you ever put on a bathing suit that          you don't even know exactly where you are inside the bathing suit? You          bump into somebody you know: "No I'm parasailing, I'm waiting for          the boat to come back."  Hey, there's the old man! (hug)  We waited 35 minutes in the rent-a-car place.  What's the difference?  I don't wanna use your car.  Nothing. It's a fine car. What if you wanna use it?  So what would you do? You'd hitch?  I don't know. 25 bucks a day.  Oh, I didn't get the insurance.  You're not paying for it.  God it's so hot in here. Why don't you put on the air conditioning?  It's not a speech. Do I have to make a speech?  (ironically) Oh yeah, that will go over real well with that crowd.  The lake isn't real.  I'm gonna put Elaine's stuff in here.  Ma.  (to Morty) What about you?  (to Helen) What about him?  No that's not such a good idea.  Not now. She's right inside.  I don't know. We decided we don't really work as a couple.  Well...  Shh! Nothing, nothing.  (tries to explain to Morty but Elaine then comes out of the guest          room to get more luggages, so he fakes a conversation) ...but you know,          look at the sun-dried tomatoes. Where were they five years ago? It just          goes to show you. You never know what... huh (waiting for Elaine to go          back in the guest room) you know... huh... What could happen to a vegetable.          It could just take right off at any time. (Morty finally gets it. So Jerry          goes on quieter) We've tried all kind of arrangments, but we can't seem          to be friend when we sleep together.  I'm looking. That's the point. I like looking.  I'm going for the record.  Oh, come on.  Nice to meet you. This is Elaine.  We're going scuba diving. We'll be back in time.  For fun.  I don't think so.  What kind of pen is that?  Yeah.  Wow! That's the astronaut pen. I heard about that. Where did you          get it?  Cause sometimes I write in bed and I have to turn and lean on    Oh no.  I couldn't  I can't take it.  No, I'm not...  I cannot take it!  Are you sure?  O.K. Thank you very much. Thank you. Gee, boy!  Thanks again.  What he gave it to me.  He offered it to me.  I liked it. Should I have said I didn't like it?  He could have said: "Thank you, I like it too" and put          it back in his pocket.  If he likes it so much, he never should have offered it.  Well, he was wrong.  So you want me to return it?  Hey I don't even want the pen now!  Are you O.K. in here?  It's only for three days. Today's over and we have tommorow. We          leave on Sunday. It's one day, really.  Oh you wanna switch? I'm sleeping on a love seat. I've got my          feet up in the air like I'm in a space capsule.  Oh, don't say that. You'll jinx me.  They're nuts with temperature.  How about that guy writing a check for 19.45?  It's one day. Half a day, really. I mean you substract showers          and meals, it's like twenty minutes. It will go by like that. (snapping          his fingers)  Stay on Biscayne.  Yes. Generally that's where scuba diving is done.  What's so special up here?  Then YOU would be hunched over.  You can't go?  Without you? That's the whole reason you came down here.  You sure?  We'll stay in a hotel tonight.  Why don't you get a new sofa?  I'm buying you a new sofa.  Hi. How are you?  Evelyn, this is Elaine.  Too thin?  (Jerry scratches his head and acts like he's not sure what she's          talking about) What?  I never really wanted the pen.  No, no, I...  All I said was "I like the pen".  Don't be alarmed.  I'm O.K. My capillaries burst.  (to Elaine on the floor) How are you doing?  Is it my imagination or is it freezing in here?  Well I started to go under...  Yeah, and I got about ten feet down and I felt this tremendous          pressure on my mask. Like my eyeballs were being sucked out of their sockets.  I got in a fist fight with one of the ladies at the pool.  Listen M. Klompus, it was really a nice gesture of you to give          me the pen, but I don't really need it.  I mean it's a terrific pen, but I think you should keep it. (he          tends the pen to Jack)  Take it.  What is going on in this community! Are you people aware of what's          happening? What is driving you to this behavior? Is it the humudity? Is          it the Muzak? Is it the white shoes?  Isn't he supposed to be the emcee?  Well. This should be a very interesting evening.  (Jerry brings her back) You took too many of those pills.  Oh God. (foreseeing an arm's grabbing as he sees Uncle Leo entering          with his wife Stella)  (to Leo) Uncle Leo.  I've got a black eye.  Elaine, this is my aunt Stella.  (to Stella) Her back hurts.  No, no.  Dad!  (in the microphone, but to Helen) I can't. Nobody's even listening.  (to himself) Oh God! (in the microphone) huh... Hey! How you folks          doing tonight? (everybody in the crowd is talking over Jerry)  (still with his sunglasses) Have you ever noticed how they always          give you the peanuts on the planes?  Who ever thought the first thing somebody wants on a plane is          a peanut?  All I said was I liked the pen!  There must be some mistake.  (to Elaine) Well there's really no point in me staying. I mean          you just gonna be...  Nothing.  Hi Evelyn.  Well today's almost over. And weekdays always go by fast. Friday          we're leaving. It's like two days really. It's like a cup of coffee. It          will go by like that. (snapping his fingers)  Yeah.  Yep. Since college. <Looks at Kramer's AIDS walk list.>          Hey, Lena Small's on this list.  Yeah, that girl I was gonna call for a date, she was unlisted...and          now here's her number.  That's why I should date a giving person. If I date a taking person,          everyone's taking, taking, taking, no one's giving - it's bedlam.  Oh, I'll tell her I met some guy who knew her and he gave it to          me.  I really didn't pay much attention, I'd just come from buying          a speedboat.  See, we're already off the subject of how I got her number. <Elaine          laughs.> All I gotta do is get past the first phone call and I'm home          free.  So if Billy had gotten your number off the AIDS walk list, you          wouldn't have gone out with him?  Yeah. So you really like this guy.  How's the...sexual chemistry?  Hello, Lena? Hi, it's Jerry Seinfeld. How did I get your number?          I met a guy that knows you, he gave it to me...I don't remember his name.          Think it began with a W, maybe a Q. I wasn't paying that much attention,          I'd just come from shopping for a speedboat...  Hey. What's the matter?  What about?  I got a date with that girl, Lena.  I actually met her a few weeks ago, but... <Jerry stops, and          mentally visualizes George telling Susan about how Jerry got Lena's number          from the AIDS list...then Susan passing the information along to Monica          on the phone at work.>  What?  I dunno. <Elaine enters.> Hey.  So what are you gonna do?  What are you all out of breath from?  And you got the AIDS walk tomorrow. You're never gonna make it,          you're in horrible shape.  I got a 31 waist, mister!  Hey, I have found the best-smelling detergent. Lena, smell my          shirt.  It's All-Tempa-Cheer.  They serve soup at 6 a.m.?   Do the bums ever complain? "Soup again?"  How could you not?  Is it a lot of cream soups?  Why'd you have to mention 'unlisted number'?  Alright, I gotta tell you something, but you cannot tell Susan.  Kramer, what the hell is going on in there?  Are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk tomorrow!  You're never gonna make it!  How'd you find out?  George!  Nothing. Listen, I'm sorry, I just -   You don't mind that I got your number off the AIDS walk list?  You went all night?  Kramer, are you out of your mind? You got the AIDS walk in like,          three hours! You're never gonna make it!  So, George, guess what? Lena found out how I got her number.  A friend of a friend of Susan's.  Why'd you tell her?!  Well you know what this means, don't you?   You're cut off, you're out of the loop!  You leave me no choice! You're the media now as far as I'm concerned!  If you were in the mafia, would you tell her every time you killed          someone?  I don't know, George.  You know what? That was the amazing thing.   No, she said it was fine. There's something very strange about          this girl.  She's too good.  I mean, she's giving and caring and genuinely concerned about          the welfare of others - I can't be with someone like that!  I mean, I admire the hell out of her. You can't have sex with          someone you admire.  No depravity! I mean, I look at her, I can't imagine she even          has sex.   I thought you said it was imminent.  Sponge-worthy?  But you like this guy, isn't that what the sponges are for?  Hi.  Oh, the shut-ins, that's nice. You know, they're a very eccentric          group. Because they're shut in. Of course, they're not locked in, they're          free to go at anytime.  Hey, that's dynamite. You know, Lena, I wanted to talk to you          about something...you know, because you're such a good person -   Oh, o.k. <Goes to the closet for the towel and finds dozens          of boxes of Today sponges.>   What? Nothing.  Oh...  Tell you something...I do.  Oh, uh...you see these jeans I'm wearing?   I change the 32 waist on the label to a 31 on all my jeans. So,          you know. That's it. <Lena is puzzled.>  It completely turned her off.  I don't wanna be a 32.  She said I wasn't sponge-worthy. Wouldn't waste a sponge on me!  It's probably so the woman has one last chance to change her mind.  Oh, I told him he'd never make it. He was up all night! Oh my          god...Kramer?  Look at you. I told you. Up all night playing poker. Come on.          <Jerry and George are about to leave. George turn's back and looks          at Kramer.>  Kramer, what are you doing here!?  You scared me!  That's enough!  Kramer! What are you doing?!  Get out! Get out of the bathroom, I gotta go!  C'mon!  Move it! Move it! Get going!  Hey, did you ever pretend there's like, murderers chasing you,          and you try and see how fast you can get your keys out and get into your          apartment?  Oh. I see. There he is! <Pretends the murderers are coming.>          The murderers! <Jerry unlocks his door and they both run inside.>  Did you see the look on that guy's face?  Kramer! What the hell are you doing here?!  All right, that's it. Hand 'em over.   What, you know what, the keys. I want the keys. You've lost your          key privileges.   No, come on!  It was sold out!    Just, look, just give the keys.  Don't ask me!  I'm telling you.  I'm serious!  Yes it will, now give me those keys!  So put 'em in a safe place.  Where?  I think so. I mean, he's acting really weird lately...he's different.  I can't.  Who's there?  Elaine...  Take the keys.  O.K.!  Your spare set?  You want 'em back?  Did you bring the keys?   This could be an emergency!  I tried to give 'em back, he wouldn't take 'em. <Jerry and          George go out into the hallway to Kramer's apartment.>  They lost.  Kramer?   Hello, Newman.  Don't play coy with me, Newman, I'm not in the mood!  You're being coy. Now where's Kramer, Newman?  Listen, Tiny. I wanna know where Kramer is and wanna know now!  Turn around, George.  Now, you better tell me where Kramer is, or are we gonna have          to do this the hard way? <Hits wall with his fist.>  Where's Kramer?  We're trying to find out what happened to Kramer.  Bad rap?  Me?  L.A.?  I never should have taken his keys away. But he drove me to it!          I had no choice! He wouldn't take 'em back. Elaine, you saw it, remember?          I said, 'Take the keys back.' He wouldn't do anything. You saw it, didn't          you see it?  Huh?   No, what'd you say?  Oh, you didn't see it.  I heard you say something, there.  I'm calling Kramer's mother. <Picks up the phone, dials.>          (To Elaine) I don't know what you said. But it was something. I heard          something. Hello? Hello, Mrs. Kramer? Mrs. Kramer? Could you turn the          music down? Could you turn the music down!  She's drunk out of her mind.  Don't feel right? What are you talking about?   What is the big deal?  First of all, you're not even supposed to have Elaine's keys.          You're supposed to give 'em back to her, so she can give 'em back to me,          because she has mine. So technically, those are my keys.  Well, I want those keys. <Tries to grab the keys from George.>  George, give them to me, I want these keys. <They struggle          over the keys.> I don't want to get physical!  Do you wanna fight?  Don't you see? You're just avoiding the middle man. You were gonna          give her her spare keys, so she was gonna give 'em to me. So, all that's          happening is that instead of giving them to her, you're giving them to          me. It's just unfortunate that when she gave you yours, you didn't give          her hers. 'Cause then she would have given 'em to me, because she has          mine. So then I would have never had to ask you for hers, so that I could          get mine.  What's that?  I heard something.  Well, this is great.   They look like keys, George. They look exactly like keys. (In          disgust) "What do they look like."  Well, they've gotta be here somewhere.  By Elaine Benes?  Elaine's writing a "Murphy Brown"?  Wait a second! (They fight over the paper.)  All right, here!   What? What?  It was funny!  Well... <picks up some of the pages> From what I saw...  I was locked out of my apartment, I'm just trying to get my keys.  I did not!  Elaine, wait! I need my spare keys!  Good!  Good! Don't! Are these my keys?  Is that something you want to do?  Elaine, let me tell you something about show business. It's hard          work! You don't just write a "Murphy Brown." You gotta watch          the show, study it, get a sense of the characters, how they relate to          each other.  What did you say?  I heard something. <Looks at the TV> Elaine, Elaine! It's          Kramer! Kramer's on "Murphy Brown"!  Look, there he is, he's sittin' at the desk!  Oh, I thought we had tickets for the Knicks home opener.  What? All right, fine.  No, I love a good Chinese Spanish whatever it is.  I get peeved.   Miffed.   Irked?   She says I suppress my emotions.   Good body.   But I get upset, I've yelled. You've heard me yell.   Kramer, I am so sick of you comin' in here and eatin' all                my food.  Sorry, I'm fixing a screen door in the Bronx.   Fix a screen door in Queens.  Not goin' to the Knick game.  You know, if you don't bring a guest they save a catering.                You  Damn it, they gave me cream! I asked for nonfat milk!   1%?! They can kiss 1% of my ass!   You're damn right you're not buying it!   I'm open. There's just nothing in there.   Oh, you think I'm lying about this?   Well, I'm not.   Oh, stop it.   That's enough!   Really? It felt good.   Tongue?   Well this kid's not just a man. He's a man's man.   Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. No, no, no, I do not                want to  Patty showed me how to get mad. You gotta problem with that?                Good.   What? The two of you workin' in that garage is like a steel                cage  What do you need it for?   (Knocking on Kramer's door) Anytown, U.S.A. Hello? Is Kramer  Boy, those azaleas are really coming in nicely.   You barbecuing tonight?   So, where do you want to eat tonight?   Again!? How much flan can a person eat!?   Well, I don't think more flan is the answer!   'Maybe'!?   Double good-bye! (As Patty leaves, open door reveals Kramer,  Yeah! In fact, she broke up with me! And I don't want to                talk about  That's the last thing she said to me. She wanted to go there                also,  It's Patty.   (Crying) What--what is this salty discharge?   This is horrible! I care!   Patty won't call me back. I don't know if I can live without                her.   I don't know what's happening to me.   That was the mother on Bewitched. You mean Pandora.   You ever heard of a little thing called feelings?   Porn quotes... I'm so lucky to have a friend like you, George.                Ever  I love you, George. Come here.   Go wherever you want. I'm still gonna love you.   Hose under my sink. I love *you*, Kramer!   I love you, Costanza.   What happened to you, pal?   Are you all right?   So, you're using Frank's relaxation method?   Sit down, Elaine.   I've been thinking about what it means to be complete.   Look at us, hurtling through space on this big, blue marble.                Looking everywhere for some kind of meaning...   When all the while, the real secret to happiness has been                right in  Elaine...   I'm asking Elaine to marry me.   Elaine?   Lippman?   Can I help you?   (Entering the hallway to his apartment) What happened here,  Kramer!   You don't look well.   Oh, I'm sorry. Look at me, I stepped on your last rose.                He's incorrigible. You want to talk about it?   George, letting my emotions out was the best thing I've                ever done.  Yikes. Well, good luck with all that.   I think you scared me straight.   What?   I tell ya, I don't see it happening.   He doesn't work here anymore.   Went out to dinner the other night. Check came at the end                of the meal, as it always does. Never liked the check at the end                of the meal system, because  But it's common sense. He's got super strength, super speed..                I'm sure he's got super humor.  Why? Why would that one area of his mind not be affected                by the yellow sun of Earth?  No problem.  Were you crying? I mean, it's just a grape. You'll find                it.  Robert.  I've been thinking about asking this girl I'm, uh, seeing                -  Vanessa, thank you.. I've been thinking about asking her                to go away for a couple of days.  You better find that grape before it mutates into another                life form. (Elaine laughs) There was once a mutant grape that terrorized                an entire town in the Texas  What stock?  Maybe.  How high's it suppose to go?  Boy.. I don't know.  What kind of company is it?  Well, how much are you going to invest?  Boy..  What if I lose it?  (gives in) All right -- twenty-five hundred.  My bet? All right.. I'll open with a tuna sandwich.  Oh, the dolphin thing?  Ooohhh.. You know, the whole concept of lunch is based on                tuna.  Hey, when I'm driving, I let people in ahead of me all the                time. I'm always waving everybody in. "Go ahead, go ahead,                go ahead." ..Alright.. alright. I'll have  I have to say. Those people talking behind us really ruined                that movie for me.  What do you want me to do? I have the guy the half-turn.                Then I have him the full-turn with the eye roll! I mean, beyond                that, I'm risking a punch in the  Have you thought any more about that trip?  You know, my friend told me about this great place in Vermont.  It's great! It speeds up the intimacy level. It's like putting                the relationship in a time compressor. Where we would be six months                from now we accomplish  Exactly. I love Phase Two. Extra toothbrushes, increased                call frequency, walking around naked.. You know, the presents get                a lot better in Phase Two.  Yeah. We can fish. What? Blues, carp, marlin?  Oh, big fighting marlin.  I know. But this is a different paper. I thought maybe they                have, uh, different.. sources.  Is that my paper?  What? What news?  Oh, c'mon! It's down again?!  Oh, I can't believe it. Let me see that. (Looks at the paper)                That's four and a half points in three days! That's almost half                my money!  (Sarcastic) Yeah, you told me.  (Holding the phone, calling George) There's one thing I                don't understand. Why does it please you? (Into phone) George Costanza,                please.  (Into phone) George, what's going on?!  (Into phone) Well, where is the guy?! Nothing? Almost half                my money's gone.. Well, call me right back. (Hangs up) Nobody can                reach Wilkinson. He  Roll-out tie dispenser? What was that one?  Okay.  You're gone alright.  Yeah, I'm going to Vermont with Vanessa for a few days.  What friends?  George.. what?! You're kidding.. Well, what's wrong?.. So,                what are we gonna do?.. Great! Alright, I'll speak to you later.                (Hangs up) Wilkinson, the guy  So you don't know what's wrong with him?  Okay, fine. Has Simons been in touch with him?  Well, this is it. I'm selling.  I never should've gotten involved in this. I'm a nervous                wreck. I"m not cut out for investing.  Where?  The hospital?  Are you nuts? You don't even know they guy.  What if he's in an iron lung or something? What are you                gonna do? (knocking on glass) "How you feeling, Mr. Wilkinson?                (makes hissing sound) By the  Who goes to the hospital to rest?  Okay, fine, fine. When are you going down there?  Alright.  Yeah. I picked up this shirt here yesterday. It's completely                shrunk. There's absolutely no way I can wear it.  What's the difference? Look at it! Do you see the size of                this shirt?!  I can't find the receipt.  Look, forget about the receipt, all right? Even if I had                the receipt- look at it! It's a hand puppet. What am I gonna do                with this?!  What do you think this is a little scam I have? I take this                tiny shirt all over the city conning dry cleaners out of money?!                In fact, forget the money. I don't even  No.. dry-cleaned.  (Interrupting) You shrunk it! You know you shrunk it! Just                tell me that you shrunk it!  I think the only reason we go to the dry cleaner is so I                can say to the dry cleaner, "Well, it's ruined." And of                course, the dry cleaner can respond, "It's not  Bless you.  So what are you gonna do?  Well, it couldn't be too expensive. Thirteen, fourteen bucks                a cat?  I'm no cat killer.  I'd really like to go, Elaine. But, George is coming back                from the hospital. I gotta wait for him. But otherwise I would definitely                go.  Yeah.  Yeah, he's nuts. You wanta bump off a couple of cats. (Enter                Kramer, holding a paper) I know, I know. It's down again.  I don't know.. fifteen hundred dollars.  You don't have to say "Wow." I know it's "Wow."                And there's that smile again. Well, what is that?  It's George. (Presses button to let George in.)  I really don't need to look.  Yeah, and you're just what she's looking for too - a stranger                leering through a pair of binoculars ten floors up.  What? What? Did you go down there? (George nods) Did he                tell you what's gonna happen? (George shakes his head "no".)                How long were you there?  You told him you knew Simons?  Well, that's it. Look, I'm going to Vermont. I don't want                to think about this. I'm selling.  So I know this guy. I'm getting all my sneakers at a discount                now.  Oh yeah, right. (To himself) Oh God. Get me out of here.                What a mistake. What made me think this would work? And I've still                got another day! I've got  Well, that's good. (To himself) Well, the drive home should                be a delight. I'm speeding the whole way. Let them throw me in jail.                I don't care. (To Vanessa)  So, I guess you don't find the separate faucets for the                hot and cold - charming?  Well, what do you wnat to do this afternoon?  We cold play "Sorry!" We cold play "Steal                the Old Man's Bundle." (To himself) Maybe I can get an extension                cord and hang myself. (To Vanessa) What  No, what? What kind is it?  (To himself) Yeah, that's normal. (Out loud, to a man nearby)                Excuse me, Sir. Could I have a look at that business section?  I did. I'm just curious. It's been almost a week. I want                to check it out. (finds stock) Six points. It's up six points!  You did not tell me not to sell.  Look, Vanessa, of course the market fluctuates. Everybody                knows that. I just got fluctuated out of four thousand dollars!  What?  No, what? 'That's probably why..'  (To himself) So, what am I looking at here? Twenty=nine                hours to go. Well, at least I got plenty of time to find out the                name of that purfume..  I'm good, thanks.  (acidly) She's full. (George puts up his hands in an "excuse                me" gesture.) So, Big daddy. I'm just curious. How much did                you clear on your little trasaction  How much?  So, Wilkinson's out of the hospital now?  Is taht still from the cats?  So, what ever happened with that?  I gotta say, that's pretty sad. Losing out to a cat.  We went over that.  A robot butcher?  I'm not an investor. People always tell me, you should have                your money working for you. I've decided I'll do the work. I'm gonna                let the money relax. You  I'm not a foodie. I don't, "Oh, this is too rare. Oh,                it's too salty." Just eat it and shut up. I'll eat anywhere,                whatever they're having. I have eaten rotten rolls  Take some of mine.  Who said you have to like it?  I don't like pesto.  (Gesturing to a man) Look at that guy. (Elaine starts to                look, but Jerry stops her) I'll bet you he's gettin' hair transplants.                Any time you see a guy that age  (To Elaine) Oh, one more thing about the car. Let it warm                up for a minute.  I don't understand why he couldn't take a cab.  Elaine is having a "houseguest." She's picking                him up at the airport tonight.  He's from a.. Yakima, right?  Everybody's moving to Seattle.  Well, from what I can piece together, our friend here met                a gentleman.  Who was in town on a business venture, and um..  So they went out a few times, but apparently, when the fellow                returned home, he discovered that the Benes tattoo does not wash                off so easily.  So, he's coming in to stay with her for a week.  (Pats George on the back) Nice going. Thank you, that ought                to get us a free dessert.. (They can see the manager chewing the                busboy out from the dining  (Casually buttering a roll, like he's the innocent one)                I didn't say anything.  (Jokingly trying to put more pressure on Elaine and George)                He'll probably kill his family over this.  (Again, joking) A lot of ex-cons become busboys. They seem                to gravitate twards 'em.  (Doesn't have a care in the world) ..Maybe I'll try that                pesto.  Look, I feel bad for him too, but he'll get another job.                I mean, let's face it, it's not a profession where you embellish                your resume and undergo a series of  Oh, like you do.  (Scoffing) Camp.  Elaine?  Busboys are always changing jobs. That's the business. I                know. I work with these guys. I tallk to them in the kitchen at                the comedy clubs.  I'd love to, but I don't know anything about him. He could                be one of those people that walks around the street pricking people                with pins.  No. (George grabs his jacket) So now you're going to his                apartment? I really think this is nuts.  You, you're going now?  Maybe the fat camp. (To Elaine) You're not going?  I just don't think you should go alone. Can't you wait till                after my set?  Take the K-man. A little support..  (On the phone) George, stop worrying about this guy. It                wasn't your fault.. Come on, he's not stalking you.  (To Kramer) Hey. (To George) He doesn't even know where                you live.. Who told you to give him your business card?.. (Intercom                buzzes) That's Elaine.  (Into phone) Kramer says it's up to the cat now. (To Kramer)                It'll be on your conscience.  (Into phone) How do you figure? (To Kramer) 'Cause you're                the one who left the door open.  (Into phone) Why was he in charge of closing the door? (Irritated                at the phone message relay, to Kramer) 'Cause you came in after                him!  (Into phone) So! (To Kramer - getting even more angry) So,                the last person in should close the door!  (To Kramer) Talk - call him from your house. (Elaine enters.                Kramer leaves. To phone) He's calling you now.. okay. (Hangs up)  No hello?  Guarantee? ..Hey, it's a car.  (Jokingly asking) So, did you have a nice week together?  There's no ping. Why are you so wacky?  So, you two been, uh..  What's your airport route?  ..What about the Van Wyck?  Oooh.  You still using that old alarm clock?  Flying doesn't make me nervous - driving to the airport                can make you very nervous because when you're flying, when you're                getting on the plane, if you miss  Anywhere in the city?  Okay.. Fifty-fourth and Sixth?  Alright.. Sixty-fifth and Tenth.  You don't mean here?  Where are you going?  (Trying to get George and Kramer out) No. You three all                know each other. There's no point in me getting involved at this                stage of the game.  He'll get another job. He's a busboy!  It was that fall down the stairs. That's what did it.  Yeah.. (Takes a bite of his sandwich as the waiter starts                cleaning off the table) How ya doing?  First of all, I can't believe that people actually do fight.                People have fist fights in life. I can't really believe that we                have boxing either. It's really kind of an  ...cramped seat, working on a tiny computer;                there's always a small problem ``There'll be a slight delay, we'll be a *little*                late, if you could be a *little* *patient*! We're just trying                to get one of those *little* trucks to pull us up just a *little*                closer to the jetway so you can walk down the narrow hallway and                there'll be a man there in a tight suit and he'll tell you you have                very little time to make your connecting flight. So move it!''.  Hey, could you do me a favour? [pause] Could                you shut-up?They both chortle, and Jerry is hot so he's taking                his coat off, but Elaine refuses to take the wheel and Jerry's hand                gets stuck and before you can say "Planes, Trains and Automobiles",                they collide head-on with a Snapple truck....  I hate rental cars. Nothin' ever works: the                window doesn't work,   So, this worked out pretty good. Them givin'                me an extra ticket, y'know, you get a free trip to St. Louis, I did my                gig, you got to  And here's the beauty--  George is pickin' us up at the airport.  You know that awning outside my building?  He's always bragging about his vertical leap,                so I bet him fifty bucks that he couldn't touch the awning.  He didn't come within two feet of the thing.                He's wavin at it...   Timed out perfectly. Drop off the car, pick                up the rental car shuttle, we walk right on the plane...  Hey! Wait up!  Uh, JFK. [To Elaine] I need some small bills                for a tip. You   Gimme ten.  Well, we got three bags.  That's what they get!  Let's ask him.  Let's see what he says.  Two seconds. [To Skycap] Excuse me, my friend                and I here, we were having a discussion and we were wondering what you                usually get for a tip.  Uh, how about a couple of people like us.  C'mon, seriously...  All right, look, we're late. Thank you very                much...  You see? Never be late for a plane with a girl.                  'Cuz a girl runs like a girl-- with the little steps and the arms                  flailing out... You wanna make this plane, you've gotta run                like a man!  We'll take 'em!  Well, so what? It's not that long-- you'll                read.  We'll call him...  No time? [To ticket lady] Is there time?  There's no time. All right, we'll call him                from the plane.  I'll take the first class.  What?  Elaine, have you ever flown first class?  All right then. See? You won't know what you're                missing. I've  Yeah, that's a point...  Yeah, I'm sure you'll live.  Bon voyage, Lainey!  Oh, sorry... My mistake... [To himself] Thank...                *you*!  Oh my...  Wow! Coming out of the shower... It's a good                thing they gave you   What is this an ad for?  Uh-huh...  Oh my... that *is* refreshing...  Sounds lovely! [To Tia, motioning to put them              on her] May I?  Why, It's a perfect fit. You must be Cinderella.  Tia, did you see all the flowers in that bathroom?                It's like an English garden in there.  I thought I smelled lilac.  Oh, saffron! That sounds good.  Oh, man. You know what... they got the fudge              on the bottom-- y'see?   Thank you...  More everything!  What is all the racket back there? You know,                you're trying to relax on the plane and this is what you have to put                up with.   Oh, you see, that's terrible. The problem is,                that curtain is no security-- there really should be a locking door.  Couldn't be...  Where are they already? I don't see them anywhere...  I got my bags, I'm ready to go.  Yeah, me too...  Okay... [To a bamboozled Elaine] It's a business                thing...  Yeah. Where's George?  But I have to admit, I like flying. I like                those little bathrooms that they have on the plane. It's kind of like a small                apartment of your own on the plane. You go in, you close the door,                the light comes on. It's like a small surprise party every time                you go in  there. The worst way of flying, I think is "standby",                you ever fly standby? It never works, you know, that's why they                call it standby--   Maybe he'll write a song about you.  So I take it he's spongeworthy?  Well, he's a musician. I guess they're supposed to be very,                you know,   Oh, no?  Come on. Come on.  Elaine, you're among friends.  Oh.  Yes, it is. It is surprising. Does that bother you?  Sure. Why not? You're there.  But you said he was just coming out of a very serious relationship.                What stuff?  All right. What are you, outta your mind? Look at this.                What did you   A four-pound can of black olives? That's a staple?  A forty-eight pack of Eggo waffles? A gallon of barbecue                sauce? Ten   Look...look at this can of tuna!  This isn't for a person. This is for Biosphere 3.  Hi.  John Germaine? That is amazing. I was just talking about                him upstairs  Oh, yeah. My friend Elaine and him are goin' out. They're                pretty hot   Hey, you'll never guess who I bumped into. This guy Clyde.                He's in   Nothing. I told him you two were pretty hot and heavy.  Yeah.  What?  Oh  Well, Clyde might not tell him.  I should have helped Kramer with those packages.  He stole back the rye?  Why?  So, do the Ross's know?  Why wouldn't they be? A rye bread doesn't just disappear.  Bad situation.   What do you mean replace it?  Well, there ya go. What's so hard about that?  All right. All right. Don't panic. Let's just think about                it. Get the   Well, Kramer'll take them around for a while.  Are you kidding? People love it. There's something about                the clip clop,   What about Susan?  Beautiful!  What the hell are you doing there?  No. No thanks.  Just put it under your shirt.  I'll tell ya what, I'll bring it over. I'll stop by Schnitzer's,                I'll   So, you think Clyde told him?  Well, maybe it's a good thing.  No, but I've read articles and I must say it, doesn't sound                very   No. I'm gonna be just fine, but as far as your situation,                you're   Wait a second, that's your last marble rye?   There's none left?  Uh, excuse me. I know this is gonna sound crazy but I -                I have to have   Yes. Well, be that as it may, if you could just find it                in yourself to   All right. All right. I'll tell ya what I'm gonna do, I                will give you   All right. Look, I'll tell ya what, I'll give you $50. Now,                be   Give me that rye!  I want that rye, lady!  Shut up, you old bag!  How much did you give him?  Yeah. Hey, what do you want me to do with this?  Really?  Will you get this horse outta here. He's killing me. I can't                get any   [grunting as he throws bread into the air]  Wait a second! I never baited a hook with a rye before.                Your hook is   Kramer, I've driven to the Hamptons many times, I know the                exit.  (To Elaine) You sure we're makin' the right move?  Didn't they just have a baby?  Is it possible they're just having babies to get people                to visit  No.  No, not for me. A little too delightful. Well, George and                Jane  I know, George is pretty pleased about it. It's like she                signed a  She's makin' the three o'clock train.  I bought him some kishka.  It's kind of a stuffed meat thing. Israeli soldiers carry                it. In  Who are you, Mrs. Robinson?  No, that's no sweet'ning the deal. No.  No thanks.  And then there's Maude. (She sits down next to Jerry)  No lines.  So when're we gonna see this baby? When is the momentous                event?  (Looking toward beach) Oh this is interesting.  Jane's topless. (They all look)  Boutros Boutros-Ghali.  Oh, in a minute, Carol.  This is weird wild stuff. George hasn't even seen her yet.  Oh, here she comes. (They pretend to not have watched as                Jane  No thanks.  So very gorgeous.  Is it me or was that the ugliest baby you have ever seen?  Boy, a little too much chlorine in that gene pool. (They                sit)  It's a must lie situation.  You know, I don't think we should tell George we saw Jane                topless.  You know, we might want to tell Kramer.  Ah, I'm gonna go pick up Rachel at the station.  Okay. (He leaves)  Oh I like that. It's like going back in time. (George comes  She's got greeting problems.  Well, the tomato's an anomaly. So successful with the ketchup  You got lobster for everybody?  (Jerry realizes the situation is hopeless) All right.  Well, when you went for the tomatoes she lied out topless.  No.  Yeah.  Think of me as a doctor. (They go outside again)  Well what'd you mean?  They'd pick her up in about ten minutes.  I guess that's true...  What do you want me to do? You wanna see Rachel naked?  You can see me naked. I can offer you that.  I've never been called breathtaking either.  Maybe he just said it because the mother was in the room.  How are you gonna do that?  You might have.  You won't.  Yes, George. I'm kind of wondering myself. What is it what                you  Oh! So you were swimming in the pool, and you wanted some                gum.  Wait'll you get to know him.  Oh, check it out. I guarantee you've never seen anything                quite so  It was my fault, I told her the wrong door.  So what?  But...  Oh... You mean... shrinkage.  So you feel you were short changed.  Well, so what's the difference?  Oh, she's not gonna tell Jane.  Women aren't like us.  No, I'm not gonna tell her about your shrinkage. Besides,                I think  Like when a man goes swimming... afterwards...  Like a frightened turtle!  No, you don't wanna do that. You'll be uncomfortable.  Yeah, the lobster'll scare him.  (To George) Easy big fella.  You told her?  You don't understand. This organ, it's very... schizophrenic.  Oh, that's just Jane driving home to New York in the middle                of the  (Referring to George) Hey, look at this guy.  Yeah.  Geez, these are delicious. Where did you learn to make eggs                like  Well, I guess I gotta go, too.  I still can't believe Michael finked on Kramer.  They got some sort of program.  Hey, isn't that Michael's car?  (A couple of days ago I used a public phone), go over time                on the call,  I tell you what they should do, they should combine the                two jobs, make  Ehh, nobody listens.  Really? I thought things were going OK.  Well what is it?  Ah, alright, four. Seinfeld.  We might as well just stay here, we haven't got that much                time if we  So did I do a terrible thing?  I couldn't have dinner with him. 'Plan 9 from Outer Space',                one night  Can't look at a menu now, I gotta be at the table.  Hey, I offered you those cookies in my house.  There's a woman over there that looks really familiar. Dark                hair,  I know this woman. This is gonna drive me crazy.  Well maybe they were here from before.  Excuse me, didn't those people just come in? I believe we                were ahead of  Seinfeld.  Boy, you are really hungry.  What?  Yeah, I wanna get into a rumble...  George, who is that woman in the stripes?  She looks so familiar.  I'll tell you what, there's 50 bucks in it for you if you                do it.  You walk over that table, you pick up an eggroll, you don't                say  They won't do anything; in fact, you'll be giving them a                story to tell  50 bucks. That table over there, the three couples.  No, no tricks.  What happened?  George, the phone's free.  I told my uncle I had a stomach ache tonight. You think                he bought that?  So what happened with Tatiana?  Come on...  I'm with you.  This could only happen to you.  You said this to her after.  Oh, boy.  Wow! So...?  What am I gonna say?  Excuse me... we've been waiting here. Now, I KNOW we were                ahead of that  Didja leave a message?  Where do I know her?  Heeeeyyyy... How you doin'?  Good, good, good... What's goin' on?  Oh, you know, working around, same stuff, doing... whatever.  I know, I know... Well, you know.  Definitely. I plan to, I'm not just saying that.  I'm sorry, Lorraine, this is Elaine...  Oh my god, Lorraine... that's Lorraine from my uncle's office.                I'm in  Yeah, she works in his office. Now she's gonna see him tomorrow                and  ...My uncle to my cousin, my cousin to my sister, my sister                to me.  Just a movie?! You don't understand.

Oh, come on, We'll divide it up three ways.  I'm counting your shrimps. OK, Who's gonna do it?  Me? What about you?  The woman's movement just can't seem to make any progress                in the world  You lost the 20.  What a sorry exhibition that was. Alright, let me get the                money back.  Seinfeld.  No no no, you see the girl there, with the long hair?  Well, actually, we did date for a while, but... it's really                not relevant  Alright, listen, alright. How much longer is it gonna be?  There seems to be a bit of a discrepancy.  Five, ten minutes.  I don't see any way we can eat and make this movie.  Well let's just order to go, we'll eat it in the cab.  We'll eat it in the movie.  Well what do you suggest?  I'm not going to 'Skyburger'. Besides, it's in the opposite                direction,  So they have hotdogs there.  Who's Cartwright?  You're not Cartwri-  So You're not going?  Well I can't go to a bad movie by myself. Who am I gonna                make sarcastic  Hunger will make people do amazing things. I mean, the proof                of that is  (word missing)....they call themselves exterminators but                they can't really do it. The best they can do   (cuts in) A nude model.  You know I went out once with a nude model. Never let me                see her naked. Hundreds of people see  Yeah!  What?  (spits the nut) OooH!!! You. you ate these? You sucked on                these and put them on the plate?  Soo...  No ,no I don't, I mean, Don't be silly..  It's just...  Oh! man did you see that. I ate discarded food.  Yeah, but with you it's intentional.  Yeah, but this is different , this is like ,you know, semi                digested food stuff. You know the next stop  Hey ,You think that Shelly's upset that I made such a big                deal about the pecan.  Thanks.  Ah! boy.  Yeah! So  Yeah! It's a doodle.  Oh!.It's an affectionate caricature.  It's just a drawing.  the usual  Good for you  Oh! Come on, you told them you're from out-of-town just                so you could stay in a hotel room.  Well be sure to catch a Broadway show while you're in town.  Oh! There coming to town tomorrow by the way.  Don't ask.  No ,it's George ( Elaine laughs heartily)  You know my parents are coming in and I got some clean up                to do , so if you and Potsie are done scheming....  What's in?  Aah! .. right. The ones from Oregon that are only ripe for                two weeks a year..  Nah, I don't wanna  I don't want it..  I DON'T WANT IT ....  I am not gonna taste your peach. I ate some one's pecan                last night, I'm not gonna eat your peach.  ..What is this?  Yeah! I think I got flea bites.  Look at this, my ankle's all bitten up.  No.  How could I have fleas?  What did you do about them?  Nothing...  Mom, Dad.....I have fleas..  I don't get this. How did this happen. I don't have a dog.  I don't understand this..  Nobody can be in here for 48 hours, I got my parents in                town.  Okay..  I have fleas.  I don't know...But every one's got to clear out of the apartment                for two days. I don't know what I'm   Come on,c'mon   c'mon ,c'mon....  c'mon, c'mon....  Yes!!!  Yes!!!  I dunno , I'm gonna ask Shelley ,but she still might be                upset from the masticated pecan incident.  Yeah.. When he's dead he'll be relieved... Oh by the way                Viking Press sent a Fedex for you to  I dunno...  That'd be the fleas.  Hey!!!  Yeah! it's all taken care of.  Oh! Hey!  Yeah! I got it . It's in the apartment, but we can't go                in there it's being fumigated.  You see?  I told you to take it.  Well, You can't go in there it's like a gas chamber in there.  Kramer, they're fumigating. There's toxic gas in there.  Aw! You'll be fine, you were in there for what , a couple                of minutes.  How do you feel?  Well wh..wh.what are you doing?  Didn't you see the sign on the door?  Can you get me a soda?  I don't know. Who could've been in my apartment.  Wait a minute . Did you say chunky wrappers?  Let me see those. ( smells them) Oh! I know the chunky that                left these Chunkies......NEWMAN!!!  Newman . Open the door, Newman, I know you're in there.  There's nothing pleasant about it, so lets just cut the                crap.. You gave me fleas. I know it and you know it..  Oh! but I do. There's probably fleas crawling all over your                little snack bar. ( as he says this Newman  You know Newman , the thing about fleas is that they irritate                the skin and they start to...itch.  Hey, thanks a lot for lettin' me stay here.  ( embarrassed laugh) ...Oh! Damn..  I forgot my toothbrush.  Yours?....You know what I'll think I'll brush later.  (long pause).......Sure. ( humms a song then stares at the                toothbrush)  Oh! my god. What the hell is this? ..... Don't tell me.......Velvet!!!  She's seen you in this thing.  And now the search for the right psychiatrist begins.  Ahh! She threw me out.  I wouldn't use her toothbrush.  Well I guess I'm stuck with the Velvet Fog.  Oh, sure. With out the parents, it's a breeze.  Hey, Tim. Great party.  You have a standard fake?  (Notices an attractive woman walking by, starts to follow                her) That's neat.  Hi, I'm Jerry.  Hey! How'd it go with the cocktail franks?  Didn't you call in sick yesterday?  (Notices George brought hhis mail) You're gonna open your                mail here?  See? You give, and you get.  Oh, that's nice.  To a children's charity!  Hey.  "Atomic Sub"? Why are you eating there?  What does that mean?  When George was growing up..  His father..  Hated all the commercial and religious aspects of Christmas,                so he made up his own holiday.  And instead of a tree, didn't your father put up an aluminum                pole?  And weren't there a feats of strength that always ended                up with you crying?  So?  No, you walk out.  No, you wait for the movie!  You don't need the card. High-end hoagie outfit like that,                it's all computerized! (Snaps) They're cloning sheep now.  So, why don't you just try your blow-off number and see                if he's called it?  What strike?  You?  Bagels?  Why didn't you ever mention this?  Hey, Tim.  Actually, I'm having dinner with a girl I met at your party.  Gwen?  (Not willing to believe how much uglier she is) Really?  Have you come across this?  (Relating) Like the Batman villain?  So, if I ask her out again - I don't know who's showing                up: The good, the bad, or the ugly.  Yeah.  (Reading it) "A donation has been made in your name                to the Human Fund." - What is that?  (Continuing reading) "The Human Fund. Money for people."  It has a certain understated stupidity.  ..Yeah.  How was your first day?  Your hands were in the dough?  Happy Festivus!  When George was growing up..  His father..  You're still trying to gget that free sub?  Is there a captain's hat involved in this?  Boy, am I glad to see you.  You never know.  So, uh, what do you feel like eating? Chinese or Italian?  (Shocked) You're telling me.  Actually, the only place she always looked good was in that                back booth over there.  I can't just keep bringing her to the coffee shop. I mean,                what if things, you know, progress?  Alright, I'll give it a shot! I do really like this coffee                shop. Nice cuff links, by the way.  That's not a french cuff shirt, you know.  Oh, that's classy.  I there. This is Kramer, and Frank.  Uh, why don't we stay here? The back booth just opened up.                (They both walk to the booth and sit down. Suddenly, Gwen is attractive)                Now this is a good  Why? It's our place.  Oh.. I know who's cooking today!  Hey, Georgie!  I'll be here.  She didn't touch it.  20 thousand dollars from Kruger? You're not keeping this.  Excuse me?  You want to give something back? Start with the 20 thousand                dollars.  You're going to start your own charity?  They nailed you on the 20 G's?  Gwen! How'd you know I was here?  Gwen. Gwen, wait! Ah! (runs back to his seat) Bad lighting                on the porch.  I thought you were on strike?  Thank you! Goodnight! (Walks off stage, sighing deeply. Instantly,          a red-headed woman runs up and hugs him - taking Jerry by surprise)  (Trying to ward her off) Hey. Hey!  Right.. Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, oh, so you saw the show?  (Modest) Oh, thanks.  (Blunt) I believe you.  (Grabbing his coat) Oh, I'm sorry, I can't - I'm going straight          to the airport.  Oh?  Uh-huh.  Uh.. well, you better not. I'm supposed to be careful with it.  Oh, okay..  Ohh.. look at this..  I bought a bottle of BBQ sauce in Memphis. I think the stewardess          broke it when she tried to jam it into the overhead compartment because          of this (Gestures to Sally's present) stupid thing.  I don't care about the sauce. It came in this funny little bottle,          and there was a guy on the label that looked exactly like Charles Grodin.  No, you don't see - because I'm going on the show this week, and          this was going to be my bit on the show.  I'm out.  (Sarcastic) Thanks for the tip.  Hey. Hey, this is for you. (Taps the gift) It's from.. uh, Susan's          roommate, Sally.  (Annoyed at the thought) Nobody hit anything off. She just gave          me the box. (Looks over at Kramer. He is scraping the BBQ sauce off Jerry's          clothes with a knife, then dipping some bread into it) What the hell are          you doing?  (Pleading) Hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.  Like what?  (Confused) Where's the punchline?  A door mat? That's what she had me lug up from Memphis?!  Federal Express?! Is she out of her mind? Why didn't she just          ship it?!  Hey, Elaine, you have got to buy this new electric toothbrush          I just got - the Ori-dent.  Oh, it's unbelievable. Every time you use it you feel like you          just came from the dentist!  Hey, what are you doing tomorrow? You want to come see me on the          Charles Grodin show?  Uh.. one of the three tenors.  Uh.. It's not Poverotti.. It's not Domingo..  (Nodding) Yeah, the other guy.  Why?  Why not?  Hey, you look awful.  Problem in the bedroom?  Wow. You were in bed with your mother last night?  I thought you didn't want the doormat.  Sally? (Getting upset) Wait, wait a minute - She's coming to New          York?  Excited? I'm gonna kill her! She knew she was coming here and          she made me carry that box?!  It's because of her that bottle got broke that I was going to          give to Charles Grodin on his show.  (While opening a cereal box) I will - don't worry. (Plotting revenge)          In fact, I'll have her bring up a whole case of the stuff. It'll be really          heavy. Let's see if she likes sitting on a plane with a big box on her          lap!  (Pulling out the toy from the cereal box - he displays even more          immaturity by holding it up, smiling) Hey! A dinosaur!  Well, it doesn't look exactly like her.  Why don't you just get rid of it?  Wait, where are you going? Don't take your dolly and go home.  I'm just glad it's outta here. (Elaine exhales deeply - getting          over the scare of the doll. She moves into the apartment) What's that?          (Pointing to a rolled up poster Elaine is carrying)  Oh. (Intercom buzzes, Jerry answers it) Yeah?  Oh, did you bring the bar-b-que sauce?  (Letting her up) Excellent. (To Elaine) So, did you buy that electric          toothbrush I was telling you about?  How come? I told you - It's fantastic.  I've had yours, I'm telling you - this one is ten times better.          Don't you believe me?  (Slightly confused by her behavior) I don't understand this. Why          wouldn't you want to get something that's better if I'm telling you it's          better? And it's not a little better - it's much better.  Come in.  Oh, hi. Elaine, this is Sally.  How was your flight? (Wishful thinking) Pretty uncomfortable?  (Let down) Oh.. (Starts to open the box) Oh, wait.. (Holding up          one of the BBQ jars) This isn't the sauce that I asked for!  (Complaining) No, no. I wanted the one in the little bottle with          that guy on it that looks like Charles Grodin!  I know it's a joke. It's supposed to be a joke! Now I'm going          on the Charles Grodin Show with nothing. (Sets the jar down angrily) Nothing!  (Peeved) I don't have any material!  (Still ticked off) That woman is such an idiot! I was gonna do          this whole bit on that bottle - and now I got nothing to talk about.  Well, maybe if I didn't have so many people in my apartment all          the time I'd be able to get some work done.  (Deeply sarcastic) No. You're never here.  Yeah. Really. (Forming and idea) Hey, you know what? Maybe I could          talk about that on the show.  Show the doll - show the picture of George's mother.. it's pretty          funny. (Moving toward the phone) I'm gonna call them.  Hello, Susan? It's Jerry.  (Disappointed) Oh. Is George there?  Uh, listen, this is important. Tell him to meet me at the TV studio          with a picture of his mother and that doll that looks like her.  (Obviously resents talking to her) Yes.  Not yet. (Points over to a man sitting in one of the room's chairs.          Whispers) The other guy.  (Joking around) Well, that's one hell of a gig. (Turning around,          he picks up a box labeled "Ori-dent") Hey, look, I got something          for you. The Ori-dent!  Well, it's a delicate mechanism - It, you know, needs lots of          packaging.  Well, I want to sit down.  It's a trick I just learned from Kramer. It keeps a crease in          the pants. (Folds his pants over the head of a chair, then sits down in          another. When he sees Elaine's staring at him, he makes a "Tada!"          gesture with his hands. Elaine holds her hand up - as if to say "I'll          see ya.", and while she's slowly walking out Jerry gives her a salute)  (Surprised to see her, he gets up) Where's George?  (Complaining) No! That's the wrong doll!  (Slow whispering) This is a nightmare.  My pants!  (unwrapping a piece of gum) I think gum is, is one of the weirdest          human  Who?  Ruthie Cohen?  Sure.  Maybe that's why she's happy.  What is this?  That stinky old movie-house?  Geoffrey who?  I thought he screwed up the Dinkins campaign.  Oh, then I'm not worried.  Lloyd.  (peering) That's an interesting package.  (chewing) Mmm, different. Where'd you get it?  Nah, don't bother.  I don't want it.  Alright.  I think I finally figured out what the flavor is in this gum.          It's a  It's Chinese gum, Lloyd Braun gave me.  You know, I remember when we parted company, I was babbling incoherently  And in the end Lloyd Braun became more like you.  Aren't you coming with us to Spartacus?  I thought your parents were outta town?  Oh, can Lloyd really do that?  We're all the way in the front row. Why couldn't we sit in the          special  Nah, you don't wanna be uncomfortable.  I don't know what I was thinking.  (noncommittal) Errh.  (taking them) Well, what's this for?  So what?  Aw, c'mon Kramer, this is ridiculous. I'm not gonna put these          on.  Ah, Lloyd.  (unenthusiastic) Oh, the gum.  (still not happy) Uh, alright. (he takes a piece)  Well, Lloyd's a very industrious fellow. I'm sure he can accomplish  's not necessary.  I know that, Kramer.  Yes I do, Kramer.  I didn't see anything.  So you say she was on a horse?  Well, here's what I propose. Go down to the stables, snoop around.          See if  Well, if it isn't Chesty La Rue.  I was chewing gum with Lloyd Braun, and he was bragging about          the  Maybe it's in the lost and found.  You know, the way you were wolfing down that popcorn, maybe you          ate it.  Alright, I'm here. Where's Braun?  Look, I'll go downtown to Chinatown with him, but that is it!  Why?  Aw, these are really strong glasses.  (lacking enthusiasm) Yeah, yeah.  Absolutely. Let's just stick around.  Lloyd?  Lloyd?  Alright.  (handing it over) Here.  (indistinct) Got all this?  (incredulous) I gave you a hundred dollars?!  It's a lotta gum!  So what's the great moment? You're on your death bed, they're                pounding on your chest - and you're going 10, 9, 8,.. I told you                this thing was good!  I know.. How about dessert?  Why?  What? Today? Really?  Yeah. And she picked the day!  No, she's great! She's.. attractive, she's fun..  She's not Lincoln.  I'll pass.  Does it ever bother you that this organization-  is beating the bushes-  to basically give this money away-  to virtually anyone, as long as they're not you?  Wow. That's great! When it comes out, I'll have to get someone                to ghost read it.  Hey.  The Van Buren Boys? There's a street gang named after President                Martin Van Buren?  Well, what does that mean?  (Sympathetically) She coming of a bad break-up?  Any messages?  They act like it was some act of charity. Just going out                with her.  There is no way Ellen is the loser of that group.  No, I'm being as superficial as I possibly can!  Yeah?  Is he smart?  Hey! Just like you pretend to be.  I had a dream last night that a hamburger was eating me!  Is that the same outfit you were wearing yesterday?  Actually, yeah. (Pause) Wait a second! Is that the fork                that fell on the floor?! (Dramatically) Are you using the fork that                fell on the floor?!  I guess that's all right.  No, absolutely nothing. (They get up to leave) You're fantastic!                (They meet up with Kramer and George on the way out) Hey guys!  (Gesturing to Ellen) Kramer, George, this is Ellen.  So you're denying him the scholarship just because he wants                to be a city planner?  You know, maybe philanthropy is not your field. (Phone rings,                he answers it) Hello. Oh, Hi, Ellen. Yeah, I called the hotel..                we're all set for the weekend.  (To George, in a 'cha-ching!' motion) Vermont! (To Ellen)                With any luck, they said we could stay an extra couple of days if                we want to! (George is  What?!  Where is this coming from? She's great!  There's nothing wrong with my career!  (Fed up) Alright! Excuse me! (Gets up) I'm not buying any                of this!  You know, this is liek that Twilight Zone where the guy                wakes up, and he's the same - but everyone else is different!  They were all like that!  Is my toaster oven on there?  Well, just shape them - change them. You're a writer.  Make them interesting.  Well, I gotta go to the airport. I'm picking up my parents.  Yeah. I'm flying them in to meet Ellen. I don't know where                to turn! I gotta see what they think of her.  I don't think so. I'm gonna try to get them to fly right                back tonight.  Kramer, this is awful! We don't want to hear about this!  What?  (To his parents) So? What do you think?  I knew it! I'm not crazy.  (After seeing how much his parents like her) Now, I'm not                so sure.  yeah, Amber.. I wonder if she's back from Vegas..  I've never been able to figure out why they make these bizarre          toilet seats that they have. You know, like those clear Lucite ones, with          all the, the coins in it? It's a lovely tribute to our past president,          by the way. It's not bad enough Lincoln got shot in the head, we gotta          pull down our pants and sit on him, too. It's just incomprehensible that          you would buy a thing like this, you install it on your toilet seat, and          this says what about you? "Well, I can't afford to just throw money          down the toilet, but look how close I am!"  I cannot believe Lindsay's still seeing you after that "Breakfast          at Tiffany's" thing.  As we all do.  Oh, so you're gonna meet the mother?  You're good with the mothers.  Maybe you should date the mothers.  Oh, you got something goin'.  What do you need a hammer for?  Oh, yeah! I wanna see that. Bring it over.  Nah, I don't think so.  Hey, could you wait until the man finishes?  Hey, guess what? Remember that woman you saw me with the other          day? You know, she used to be an Olympic gymnast?  Yeah, she's Romanian, she won a silver at the '84 Olympics.  Yeah, well, I think I'm bailing.  Yeah, you know, Kramer, there's always a price to pay for just          a sexual dalliance.  She's Romanian. What am I gonna talk to her about, Ceausescu?  (watching George buttoning his shirt) What is this?  (stares at George, incredulous) "Back on"? What was          it doing off?  (laughing) What for?  Unbuttoned, or all the way off?  Of course.  What, again? Kramer, if you keep getting these attacks, you should          see the doctor and have it checked out.  (picks up newspaper, turns to George) You always take the shirt          off?  Boy, I tell ya', knowing you is like going out in the jungle.          I never know what I'm going to find next, and I'm real scared.  (trying desperately to make conversation) So, Ceausescu. He must've          been some dictator.  He, uh, he must've been dictating first thing in the morning.          "I want a cup of coffee and a muffin!"  No, you'd have to be crazy.  Yes. Very bad. Very, very bad.  So lemme get this straight: you find yourself in the kitchen.          You see an clair, in the receptacle. And you think to yourself, "What          the hell, I'll just eat some trash."  Was it in the trash?  Then it was trash.  But it was in the cylinder!  Adjacent to refuse, is refuse.  Was it eaten?  Well, that's garbage.  Well, you, my friend, have crossed the line that divides Man and          Bum. You are now a Bum.  Hey!  What's with you?  What stone?  What is that, anyway?  Oh, that's gotta hurt.  Good for you.  Y'know what you should do now? Get her some flowers, smooth it          out.  Kramer, are you still on this? I've seen gymnasts. I know what          they do. It's not going to make any difference.  Kramer, y'know, guys like you, with no conscience, don't know          what it's like for guys like me. I'm in the unfortunate position of having          to consider people's feelings.  No.  No.  Boy, you can really talk some trash. (to George) I guess that's          better than eating it.  All right.  (pointing at TV) Hey, that's her!  (smiling and excited) Well, here we are.  How did you stay on that beam like that? (holds up hand) I mean,          it's only this wide!  Oh boy...  I couldn't believe it. Uh, I mean I thought I was entering a "magical          world" of sensual delights, but it was just so ordinary. I mean,          there was nothing gymnastic about it.  Well, you know. I mean... I dunno.  Well, obviously I prefer not to mention any, you know...  You see, now I really don't want to get into this, any kind of          specifics...  Well... Frankly, I thought, you know, I was gonna kinda' be like          the apparatus.  See, again, I really don't feel that...  Could we stop?  All right. Let's just drop it.  So lemme ask you this: how long would you say I have to put in          now because of, you know, last night.  (sarcastic) Oh, great.  Between Poland and Morgan?  Kramer! The stone!  What happened, did you pass the stone?  Strike two!  You're behind in the count.  I'm going out with Katya, thanks to you.  If I do it again, that extends my payment book another two weeks.  We're going to the circus. One of her old Olympic teammates is          an acrobat. I don't even feel like going out.  Yeah, well, y'know what? If I gotta go, and spend time with this          girl, then you're coming with me, Dr. Cyclops!  Yeah, well you're going.  "Greatest Show on Earth"!  Well, they certainly take up a lot of space.  Well, break a leg.  Eh, show biz...  Boy, those capes are really coming back.  What is that sound?  Oh, why not?  Really?  She hasn't told her father yet?  "We're"? What do you mean, "We're"?  You're meetin' the father for the first time?  (Chuckles slightly) Well, you'll make quite an impression                on him when you tell him how you burned his cabin down.  (Laughs) I mean, the whole thing is ironic. Think of it:                Here the guy is nice enough to give you a box of very fine Cuban                cigars..  No, but wait, wait: And then you dump them off onto Kramer..  (Continuing) ..Who, who proceeds to burn the man's cabin                down with one of those very same cigars! (Topping off his observation)                It's very comical..  (Persisting) No, no, we put this off long enough. Today's                the day.  (Agreeing) C'mon. It's not even a house - it's, like, a                cabin.  (Blunt) Well, maybe not us, but two men could.  What, you got a problem with the pen now?  Alright, let's just get to work. (They both move into the                living room - ready to start writing their script. Jerry sits down)                NBC Pilot, Seinfeld project. Act I,  (Wanting to get started) Just - just park yourself. (George                reluctantly sits on the sofa) Alright. Act I, Scene A.  No, no thank you.  Act I, Scene A..   (Eagerly reaching for the phone) Yes. (George turns the                TV on, and begins watching as Jerry dials the number) Hi, is Elaine                there? Oh, uh, Hi, Sandra. Uh,  Okay, let's go. (George shuts the television off, ready                to work)  Yeah.  Okay, how about this: I'm in my apartment, you come in.  Here we go.  Yeah, come on. (Kramer gives out a frustrated sigh) What's                with you?  Why?  Yeah.  What?!  (Looking at his watch) You got four hours! What about the                script?  Right after we get off the phone, then you go and tell her                that?! Well, of course she knows it was me who complained! Now I'm                responsible for this  (Caving in) Ohh.. dial the number. (Elaine picks up the                phone, and starts to dial) How could you do this?  (Muttering) Oh, just trying to (Rudely grabs the phone from                her) help me.. (Into the phone) Hello? Sandra? Hi, uh, this is Jerry                Seinfeld. (Elaine now has her  What?!  What? What?! You were the one who was talking dirty. I was                just trying to keep up!  Why? It didn't mean anything. I was just trying to join                in so you wouldn't feel embarrassed.  (Getting slightly offended) I'm not sick. (Pointing at her)                You - you said much sicker things than me.  I really think you're making too much of this.  Let me walk you to a cab.  I mean, the main thing is that this is just between us,                and that'll be the end of it.  (Calling after her) I mean, people - they're not interested                in things like this. They don't want to hear about it. They really                don't.  So, we're.. uhh, drinkin' and talkin', and uhh, so, she                starts rubbing my leg.  (Sarcastic) Have you ever told a woman to stop touching                your leg?  I mean, I know it's the wrong thing to do. She works in                Elaine's office. I know it's wrong - but I can't get that hand off                my leg. I mean, I'm looking at the  I don't know, they're working on a whole other level..  So we go back to my apartment..  So, we're, uh, foolin' around there.. you know, it's getting                a little passionate.. (Scoots closer to George, to prevent others                from hearing) and, uh, she starts  (Modest) Oh, you know, the usual..  Typical things.  She says, uh.. (Mumbles something inaudible. George, so                shocked by what he's just heard, accidentally squeezes the ketchup                bottle - ketchup squirts out  ..And then she starts talking about her panties.  So I said something.  (Defensively) Now, bear in mind, I am just trying to keep                up.  Okay? So, she's taking about her panties, so, uh.. So, I                said, "You mean the panties your mother laid out for you?"  (Throwing up his hands) I don't know! It just popped out.  She flipped out! Just left.  Look, the main thing is I don't want Elaine to know about                any of this. I mean, especially the panty remark. I mean, it's embarrassing.                And she's never let me  She will tell her. She's going back to work. I talked her                into it - how stupid was that? (Changing subject as they both collect                money to pay for the check)  I guess he failed to see the humor in it.  (Getting up) Alright, big work day.  Let's go.  Right now.  You and me.  Alright.  (Reading from his notebook) I got: You enter, you go "Hi",                and I go, "Hello." Now.. we need something here..  Come in, we're taking a break.  Yeah!  (Stirring, he gets up to answer the buzzer) Alright, let's                get going. C'mon, c'mon now. (Approaches the intercom) C'mon, let's                get it together.. (Through  C'mon up. (Slightly opens the door for Elaine)  (Agreeing) Yeah, we should.  Yeah. Wha - what, does she live with them?  Oh.  What?  Well, then, you've just got to fire her! Don't even think                about it - there's no two ways about it.  Talk? Did I talk? It - you're darn right I talk to her!                We talked up a storm - and I concluded from the basis of these talks                that this isn't anybody you should  Yes.  Oh yeah. Yeah, in fact, if George and I weren't so busy                here working on the script, I'd do it myself.  Hi.  Ah, just - takin' a little break.  (Looking at his watch ) Yeah..  Yeah. (Tapping his watch) Look at the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, and, (Pointing to his watch) because of the.. (Slowly                exiting) time.  (Waving good bye) We'll see ya.  Alright, let's go.  Right now.  You and me.  No foolin'  (Looking at his notebook) Alright, I got, uh, you come in,                you say "Hi", and I say "Hello".  Yeah.. how about this: I say "How's it goin'?"  (Getting up to answer the door) Alright, did you get that                line?  Did you write it down?  Okay.. (Opens the door to a frantic Elaine)  What?!  What?! How?  What calls?!  Oh, did - did she say anything else to you?  So she just left the office - didn't say a word to you about                anything?  (Smiling to himself) Beautiful.  Oh, no, not beautiful.  Hey, look, I'm going to pay for that.  (Taking out his checkbook) No, I insist. I was the one who                encouraged you to fire her - the whole thing was all my-  (Pauses, noting Elaine's quick accept) fault. (Starts to                write a check out, then stops, looking at the door) Do you smell                smoke?  Oh, how you doing? Nice to meet you.  Oh. (Notices Louis' jacket) Isn't that, uh, your..  Uh, yeah, I'm familiar with some of his writing. (George                shoots Jerry a smirk, then returns to his book) Alright, (Hand the                check to Elaine) look, we gotta  (Moving back into the living room) Okay.  Hey.  Well, what'd you say?  What's his problem?  He called the right guy.  All right, I'm leaving. I going to the laundry.  Fluff and fold. The only way to live. [snapping fingers                in tune with  Wait a sec. I don't wanna do --  I don't wanna mix in everything! My guys don't know your                guys. You  No. I can't say as I have.  All right. Put 'em on top.  Oh, beautiful. This stuff on top is my friends'. Could I                get it done  Whatever it costs. In fact, I would prefer it if the machines                are  How did you know I was here?  I don't know.  Get outta here.  What happened? Levitan?  You and your toilets.  So, what are you gonna do now? Are you gonna look for something                else  So what are you gonna do?  Uh-huh. Uh-huh. In what capacity?  Yeah. Well, that - that could be tough to get.   Yeah. Yeah. You make good comments.  Well, they tend to give those jobs to ex-ballplayers and                people that  I know. Well, okay. Okay. What else do ya like?  Yeah. Yeah.  Projectionists.  But you gotta know how to work the projector.   And it's probably a union thing.  Talk show host. That's good.  Really?  Well, that's where it gets tricky.   I wouldn't think so.   All right. Okay. Sports, movies, talk show host. What else?  Well, it doesn't sound like you completely thought this                through.  Maybe you can just go back.  Yeah. Pretend like it never happened.  Sure. You're an emotional person. People don't take you                seriously.   Never happened.  So what? You're entitled.  That's right. You're emotional.  Never happened.  Well, so that's that.  That's not that?  Well, if that's not that, what is that?  What kind of plans?  You don't wanna tell me?  What? In his drink? Are you outta your mind? What? Are you                Peter  What if you destroy him?  Well, wha - what does that do? Big deal.  You've really gone mental.  Where are you gonna get this mickey? I can't believe I'm                saying  You got a mickey sauce?  Elaine? How did you rope her into this?  She knew that.  What is the point of all this?  Oh, the best revenge is living well.   Did you get your laundry?  What's with you?  What?  Did he call you last night?  What did you say?  Whew. Did he wave?  Oh, my god!  Well, on Thursday when I came home I had $1500 on me. For                some  To the Laundromat.   Oh, I see. So, you put up a sign so you can do whatever                you want?  So, anybody leaves anything here, you can just take it?                You have a  Come on. Let's go.  Maybe we should call this off.  And what's gonna happen?  If only you could put your mind to something worthwhile.                You're like  What about the gentle cycle? You ever use that?   Do you think it's effeminate for a man to put clothes in                a gentle  What about fine fabrics? How do you deal with that kind                of  What about stone washing? You ever witness one of those?                That must  Yeah. That's true. What? My God, the money! The 1500! Where'd                you  In your laundry the whole time? I told you not to mix in                our guys.  Elaine, come on, take a walk with me down to the Laundromat.                I gotta  I don't know. Blind date?  Yeah, but I've seen pictures of her.  I think I'd rather go out on a deaf date than a blind date. The          question is whether you'd rather date the blind or the deaf.  You know, I think, I would rather date the deaf.  Because I think the blind would probably be a little messier around          the house. And lets face it they're not going to get all the crumbs. I'd          possibly be walking around with a sponge.  Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit.  A healthy person.   Oh, sorry  I still can't believe, you're going out on a blind date.  You're going by sound? What are we? Whales?  Elaine, what percentage of people would you say are good looking?  Twenty-five percent, you say? No way! It's like 4 to 6 percent.          It's a twenty to one shot.  Way off? Have you been to the motor vehicle bureau? It's like          a leper colony down there.  UNDATEABLE!   Alcohol.   Pulp couldn't make it across the table.  Hey, I eat healthy. If I have to take out an eye, that's the breaks.  Hi,   Well, I'm not really that much of a meat eater.  Well, no, I'm not one of those.  Grandma Memma?   No, I think I would have remembered Memma.  What do you recommend besides the steak?  Anything lighter? How do you prepare the chicken?  You know what? I think I'll just have the salad.  (mind's voice) Just a salad? Just a salad? Just a salad?  Maybe his dogs heard about how you tried to kidnap that other          dog. These muts like to gossip. So have you talked too Holly?   Did she mention anything about our lunch?  What do you mean, "kind of."?  What are you saying? . . . Salad! What was I thinking? Women don't          respect salad eaters.  But you're going over there for dinner tonight, right?  What is she making?  Oh, don't worry. I'll be there and I'll be packing an artery.          Um, mutton! Hope you didn't cut the fat off.  Hey, salad's got nothin' on this mutton.  I wish I could take credit for it. It's actually the line my butcher          uses when we're chewing the fat. How about that beautiful desk over there?          (hides meat in napkin in jacket)  This is some FINE mutton.  Uh, well, uh the thing is that . . . (Jerry grabs jacket back)  What?  I don't know about that. Have you got any floss?  Elaine, what are you doing in this neighborhood?  Yeah, they're in the kitchen. . . . okay, quite! What's going          on?  Why were dogs chasing you?  I would askk you to stay tonight but I only have the sofa bed          and it's where I sleep.   Head to toe?  I'm sorry I didn't get any sleep you kept kicking me in the face.          I'll make them later. Uh.  It sounds like all the winking got you a promotion.  Because they were in the pockets of my jacket.   Yes. I was using them to spit out the mutton.   I don't know and I didn't want to find out. So where is my jacket?          You spent the night at James's? Did we?  Reversed positions?   So what your genitals are still lined up.   Yeah. Come on up.  Hey. What's all this?  I thought we were going out.  Franco?  I bet he acted aloof like he didn't know me.  That is so Franco.  I usually like mine with an angioplasty.  What everyone does here. - Cooking pork chops.  We could argue all night over who took the napkins. The point          is in today's modern world it just doesn't seem relevant.  Hey, what happened to my jacket?  Uh, sometimes I use the sofa.  Yeah?  What do you mean that's it?  "Of course" was the last thing he said?  "I want you to have this job, of course sodomy is a                prerequisite."  So if you call and ask if you have the job, you might lose                the job.  You might have the job, but you'll never know it. What kind                of company is it?  Shower?  Who'd you use? Gino?  Well I've been going with him for 12 years. I can't switch.                I'd hurt his feelings.  Really?  I believe they've had a cure for polio for quite some time.  Okay.  Oh hi Enzo.  No, actually I was just...  Well I, if it's your day off I really... (tries to leave)  Well I don't want to take too much off.  What if I shampoo? Sometimes a shampoo helps.  I can't. He loves me. He says I'm his most loyal customer.                Plus he's right there on the corner. I'd  I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.  He did the job. You told me he wasn't going to be there.  I didn't want to hurt his feelings.  No Kramer. I don't want you to do that. You can't do that.  I don't want you to call him.  Yeah that's a tough one. What are you going to do about                that?  Yeah?  What do you mean you show up?  Hmm. Not bad.  Well, you'd be embarrassed and humiliated in front of a                large group of people and have to walk out  So what did you do there all day?  So it's a nice place to work?  What about your boss? The guys you interviewed you?  Hi.  I got a haircut.  Oh there's nothing to see.  Forget it.  All right.  Well I'll tell you this, you can forget about me going to                that bachelor auction.  Yeah, but how am I...  Thank you.  Well actually Enzo hasn't said that to me in a while.  That's nice of you to say.  In the one minute he worked on me I could tell he was really                good.  Enzo picked up one of my hairs off the floor.  I think he knew.  Who do you know? He knows my hair.  Okay, okay.  He didn't get to finish it. His uncle came in. We almost                got caught.  Take the K-man.  How do you know?  Who is it?  All right, go in the bedroom. Open the window. You can go                out the fire escape.  What do you want?  What's wrong with yours?  You can't unclog it?  Did you ask Kramer?  Number one?  All right. Flush twice.  You all right?  All right, I'll see you later.  I'm watching Edward Scissorhands.  Yeah all right.  You want something to drink?  If you want to watch, sit down. You're making me nervous.                I tell you this Scissorhands is a hell of   I don't get this Scissorhands. What, is he supposed to be                like a super hero, like Green Lantern or   Who is it?  Oh my god, he knows. (Jerry and Gino scrambling) Go. (yelling                to the door) One second.  No I wasn't there.  Sample? (under his breath) Newman. Uh, I was there but I                was just dropping off a book.  I saw it.  Okay. I wouldn't see it again.  I noticed she's big on the phrase "yada yada."  No, "yada yada" is good. She's very succinct.  Yeah, it's like you're dating USA Today. (Tim the dentist                enters Monk's)  Hey, George, you know Tim Whatley.  What's up?  Excuse me?  Well... (Thinking of something to say) Welcome aboard.  Elaine, the guy's Jewish two days, he's already making Jewish                jokes.  Booze is not a religion.  Ooh. Beth Lookner, still waitin' out hat marriage.  I gotta get on that internet. I'm late on everything.  What're you doing here?  Well this is very awkward.  Hey, you don't play with that. That's going in my mouth.  All right, that's enough. Now get going. Get outta here.                (Tim and his staff enter)  George...  Hey.  Tim, do you think you should be making jokes like that?  I know, but...  5000.  And then he asked the assistant for a schtickle of flouride.  I'll tell you why. Because I believe Whatley converted to                Judaism just for the jokes. (Phone rings)  Yes. (Slams down phone. Kramer and Mickey enter)  All right, take it easy.  How you doing?  Whatley. (Like "Newman")  So Whatley sayd to me, "Hey, I can make Catholic jokes,                I used to be Catholic."  Don't you see what Whatley is after? Total joke telling                immunity. He's already got the two big religions covered, if he                ever gets Polish citizenship there'll be no stopping him.  I think this Father Curtis might be very interested to hear                what Whatley has the Pope doing with Raquel Welch.  They're not getting a baby so you're taking them out to                lunch?  Poor Beth.  Oh screw him! (George enters)  But you yada yada'd over the best part.  George is already in there.  I thought you were leaning towards Julie.  Excuse me, Mother?  Sister, right. Do you know when Father Curtis has office                hours?  Hmm, I really need to speak with him.  Oh. (Adjusts accordingly)  Well I should tell you that I'm Jewish.  Oh good. Anyway, I wanted to talk to you about Dr. Whatley.                I have a suspicion that he's converted to Judaism just for the jokes.  No, it offends me as a comedian. And it'll interest you                that he's also telling Catholic jokes.  And they're old jokes. I mean, the Pope and Raquel Welch                in a lifeboat.  Oh, I'm sure you have. They're out on the ocean and, yada                yada yada, and she says, "Those aren't buoys." (Father                starts laughing) Father...  You know the difference between a dentist and a sadist don't                you?  Newer magazines.  (In pain) Oh, are you about done?  Huh?  What about all your Jewish jokes?  The Jews?  Is that why it's so hard to get an appointment?  Date with Karen?  What happened to Karen?  Oh, small world. So little people can have not little people                children?  So you won't believe what happened with Whatley today. It                got back to hime that I made this little dentist joke and he got                all offended. Those people can be so touchy.  What?  Kramer, he's just a dentist.  I am not an anti-dentite!  They do have their own schools!  Well, what's wrong?  Talk to me.  Well, I wouldn't put anything past anybody.  Well obviously that was a mistake. You need to forget about                Arnie. The important thing is you're moving on.  Forget about Elaine. Let's just focus on us. Come on, big                hug. (Mickey and Karen enter)  I'm kinda in the middle of something.  Oh, congratulations. Her marriage just fell apart.  Beth and Arnie broke up.  (Shaking his head no) Pff.  Hey, where's Marcy?  Hey, Kramer, over here.  Kramer... Oh look, there's Mickey and his parents.  Very handsome.  Hi, Mr. Abbott.  Oh, I said something about dentists and it got blown all                out of proportion.  What?  That's a good one. Dentists.  She went out to get her head shaved.  Those wisdom teeth are tough to get out.  Oh, it won't be for that long.  Hey, my parents are just as crazy as your parents.  My father has never thrown anything out. Ever!  My mother has never set foot in a natural body of water.  A smirk?  I told you I'd lend you the money for the rent.  (Stopping the notion) What's that?  Fine, Mrs. Costanza. (Attempts to get Estelle to laugh)                Hey, I got a terrific joke for you..  No, no. It's really funny. There's these two guys-  No thanks.  I really don't eat it.  I don't know if I'd feel comfortable handing out bologna                sandwiches in the building..  Well, I guess we'll be going.. (Heads for the door)  Yeah.  Oh, Elaine and I are going out to dinner with Kramer and                his new girlfriend.  Yeah, You can't believe this woman. She's one of those low-talkers.                You can't hear a word she's saying! You're always going 'excuse                me?', 'what was  Yeah, take it easy. (Leaves)  Right.  Well..  Excuse me?  Yeah.. yeah.  Puffy.  Yeah, that's right!  (Points at Elaine) And the indigent.  Sure.  Uh-huh.  Yep..  (Shrugs) I - I don't get it.  What is it?  They're hands!  (Gets up, and displays his own hands) Well, what about my                hands? I don't see how your hands are any better than my hands.  Well, that's what comes from avoiding manual labor your                whole life.  Hey.  (Explaining) George has become a hand model.  Yes.  Oven mitts?  Alright. (Jerry opens the door for George)  Uh-huh.. (Finally realizes what Kramer said, he looks up)                Since I said what?  What are you talking about?  (Goes up to it) This?  I agreed to wear this?!  But, when did I do that?  What are you, crazy?!  I don't know! I couldn't understand a word she was saying!                I was just nodding!  Where I go? You mean she was asking me to wear this ridiculous                shirt on national TV, and I said 'Yes'?!  But, I - I didn't know what she was talking about. I couldn't                hear her!  I - I can't wear this puffy shirt on TV! I mean, look at                it! It looks ridiculous!  They're making these?!  (Like a little kid) But, I don't want to be a pirate!  (Resisting) Kramer, how am I gonna wear this?! I can't wear                this!  (Obviously mad at the situation he's in) 'Why am I wearing                is now?'? I'll tell you why I'm wearing it now - because the lowtalker                asked me to, that's why!  When we were at dinner, when Kramer went to the bathroom.  (Yelling out) Of course not! Nobody hears anything when                this woman speaks!  (Arms out, complaining) I have to wear it! The woman has                orders for this shirt based on me wearing it on TV.. they're producing                them as we speak!  (Mumbling out) Thank you, Bryant.  (Looking down at the shirt) Oh, thank you.  Yeah, it's a puffy shirt.  To me,            the whole concept of fear of success is proof that we are definitely            scraping the bottom of the fear barrel. Are we gonna have to have AA-type            meetings for these people? They'll go: "Hi, my name is Bill, and the            one thing I'm worried about is to have a stereo and a cream-colored            couch." According to most studies, people's number-one fear is public            speaking. Number two is death. *Death* is number two! Now, this means            to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you're better            off in the casket than doing the eulogy.  Look we've            been through this already. You're not an actor!  I know.            So why do we need two people in the show that can't act?  My grandmother's            in the hospital.  This is            real believable.  It stinks.  Say something            funny.  Ah..........  We're acting.            (they stop laughing)  No.  (to George)            He wants to play Kramer in the Pilot.  Hello?            Yeah he's here. (to Kramer) Hey! It's for you.  (to George)            Again with the sweat pants?  You know            the message you're sending out to the world with these sweat pants?            You're telling the world: "I give up. I can't compete in normal society.            I'm miserable, so I might as well be comfortable." (George is baffled)  (to Kramer)            Who is it?  NBC!?!            Give me the phone!  Get off            the phone!  You know            I'm waiting to hear from them. Who was it?  All right.            Now you're doing something to help me. (to the phone) Hello yeah it's            Jerry Seinfeld returning the call. Uh-huh.. O.K. great thanks a lot.            (hangs up)(to George) Casting tomorrow at NBC. 4:00. We're in business            baby, the pilot's on. You're gonna successful. (George looks disappointed)  Where?  Get out            of here, it's nothing. (Jerry knows George is hypochondriac. See 'The            Heart Attack')  Would you            stop?  If you            go, maybe they'll catch it in time.  Whatever            it is.  (to George)            You know these squeegee-- Oh my God! It's crazy Joe Devola. (they both            % )  Yeah, where            is Russell? I thought he was gonna be here.  (thinking)            They've gotta be kidding.  Everything            all right?  No you            didn't. He knows he's bald.  (getting            up) Uh, you know what? I'll read with her.  Alright,            want to start?  O.K.  What look?  I gave            a look?  (smiling            and surprised at the way Tom is talking) Good.  Very good  (to George)            It was a wonderful reading.  Yeah, I            liked him.  (to Kramer)            What are you doing here?  Oh, don't            worry about it. Very talented, very takented young actress.  Yes.  She's an            eskimo, actually.  She came            down from Juno by sleigh, she was in the Iditarod. Got to the finish            line, just kept going. She's got the dogs with her in the hotel room.  No, he            didn't show up.  No. No            you're not.  I don't            know.  Yeah. Have            you noticed anything else that's different since the new management?  Beside            that. Look at the waitresses.  What physical            characteristic would you say is common to all of them?  I mean            look at this. Every waitress working here has the same proportions.            Wouldn't you say?  What's            going on here. How is that possible?  No. I haven't            seen four women like this together outside of a Russ Meyer film.  Hey that's            life. Good-looking men have the same advantages. You don't see any handsome            homeless.  What did            he say?  Alright.            So?  Well, maybe            he doesn't have a "get outta here" kind of personality.  Can't you            at least die with a little dignity?  Hey. What            happened to you yesterday?  Mugged?  Why didn't            you use the bathroom in the building?  Yeah?  Come on            up.  What is            it?  You didn't            go?  The % thing            to do is just not think about it.  He's a            little backed up.  Oh, the            sisters (he sits at the table)  This is            what you gonna wear?  You're            not gonna get the job.  (to the            phone) Hello. Oh, hi. Yeah I guess we could do that. At what time? All            right. I'll see you there. O.K., bye. (hangs up)  TV Elaine.            She wants to get together and talk about the part.  They're            having sex in the hotel room.  Yes.  Uh, Huh,            yeah.  Well, she's            fascinated with Greenland. She enjoys teasing animals, banlon, and seeing            people running for their lives. She loves throwing garbage out the window,            yet she's extremely dainty.  With her            hands.  Also with            her hands.  Everything?  All right            she cuts her pasta with a knife.  Shaft.  She likes            talking during sex.  No. Just            chitchat, movies, current events, regular stuff. You know Sandi-- (looking            at his watch)  What?  All right.            Elaine.  Well--  Actually            she has a thing where she spirals her tongue around, it's like--  I think            you got it.  Well, you've only got another fifty years or so to go before                it'll  Yeah, how about a mute?  Ah, where you gonna meet a mute?  A deep, yawning chasm...  Listening to you. I listen to this for fifteen minutes and                I'm on  Hey! How you doin'?  What're you gonna do down there?  That's what I do with him [points at George]  What, do you break it in with her, then you try it out on                me?  Nah, it's not for me.  I think I'm pretty much like you-- only successful.  Thank you.  Fields. Sidney Fields. *87* years old. *87*. How about your  *We*? No.  George and I just signed up with the Senior Citizen's Volunteer  What're you talkin' about?  What?

So Mr. Fields I just don't know if this arrangement is--  Where's his teeth! Where's his teeth!  Well turn the light on...  That's the garbage disposal!  Yes, but--  [Into intercom] Yes?  Alright, c'mon up.  [To Rep] I dunno what happened, we were just trying to take  Um, well, his false teeth got mangled up in the garbage  Well, after he bit my friend--  I, I'm sorry.  Well, I brought them up there to take his records--  There you are. Did you find him?  So your saying UNICEF is a scam?  Oh! No it's Sally Weaver.  No , It's Susan Ross's old college roommate; she moved to                New York a few years ago . she's trying   Untalented, She's always inviting me to see her in some                bad play in tiny room without ventilation.  She should just give up.  Heeyyy!...  Kramer!!!  So......Susan's dead.....  Why'd you have to say anything to her?  Why can't you ever keep your big mouth shut?  What did you wanna be?  I don't either.  It looks like my accountant's office but there's no pets                working there.  You've been hiding her from us. you must really like her?  She does not.  Hey! Kramer.  What! You're the one who ruined her life.  Well , I got to talk her out of this.  She does stink and she should quit. But I don't want it                to be because of me. It should be the  Yeah...  George's girlfriend , Elaine thinks she looks like me but                I think it's as you would say ,kookie talk.  What are you doing? Don't tell a woman she looks like a                man and George doesn't want to hear his   You don't broach, you keep your mouth shut.  Yeah! Because of you.  Sally ,you can't quit the business. This is all because                of me.  You can't give up. You don't think people tell me I stink?  Of course , I stink , you stink. It's show bizz. everybody                stinks..

Well what does this mean?  Kramer there's no way you stick to this.  Oh! you just startin' now?  Ah! There you are.( Kramer motions silence)  ( to Kramer) Oh! Shut up!!!  Good luck , It's sold out for the next three weeks.  The New Yorker?  Wow! Good work, Nancy Drew  Nodding off...  Wow! that's incredible......But you don't draw.

No ,no I tought the show was terrific. I was just wondering                if you have to keep saying Jerry Seinfeld  I know but I thought that maybe you could mention how I                apologized then encouraged you to stick with it.  You got a little shmootz there (picks something on her sweater)  What a surprise.  There really was shmootz on I didn't try to grab her  Get Out of my House!!.  I'd stayed up all night I'd fixed myself up a little before                I'd go out.  some mouthwash , a hat , something.  (glances at it) Pretty good.  It's a pig at a complain department.

This cartoon stinks.  oh! that's it I'm gonna put an end to this.  Now that's a complaint. ...Hello Sally , yeah this is Jerry                ,I just wanted to leave you a message that I   ....I'm getting a little tired of hearing how horrible I                am and would appreciate it if you would leave  (from the back of the club , leaving) That's it I'm calling                in the big guns.  How could she say that on TV?.. And how did she get a cable                special . I 've never gotten a  You ripped off a Ziggy?  I see that Ziggy's back at the complaint department.. "The                New Yorker is stealing my ideas."  Hey! Kramer come on in. You've got to watch this , now she's                got nothing.  That's right sister. Why don't you just give up?  Elaine , have you been talking to her?  ( to Kramer) I thought you stopped talking??  You broke up with her just because she cut her hair! how                short?  You mean like.. ( points to his hair)  So she..  And you don't...  Hmmmm...  No , no......( long pause . they stare at the walls) Hey                uh.. you want to see a movie?  I think that's for the best.  That's good stuff.  Can you grab a nap at work.  So what are you doing now?  With a gentleman caller?  The walking date is a good date. You don't have to look right          at the other -person.  Shower?  A little slow. I've got to hold this guy's hand on every little          decision.  Yeah.  You know, why don't we just go with the one in your hand?  Drop one. . . . left!   A little less beady today.  Sounds like a really cool fort.   He's kind of tied up here.  Why don't you just work on George's project for a while?  So how was Wednesday's walk in the park with Hal.  I don't know.   What happened?  How long did that last?  How was the movie?  Why?  So you think he was expecting a roll in the supportive hay.  So what are you going to do with the mattress?  How about this? . . . Finish this thing up today!  No. No more questions. Just figure it out for yourself and get          it done.  Just . . . do it.   Hi.  What is that smell?  You're swimming in the East River? The most heavily trafficked          overly contaminated waterway on the eastern seaboard?  How could you swim in that water?  Swimming?  (on phone) hello.  Who is this?  Why don't you just have him paged?  A bomb threat? Why would I call in a bomb threat?  I should have some reason.  Yeah.  Over here. You can see right through here.  It's kind of cozy.  Does it smell like the East River?  Because Kramer has been swimming laps between the Queensborough          bridge and the Brooklyn bridge.  I don't think it's that bad.  No the stools go over there.  Hey look at you.  No knock offs. I want the ones like the real players wear.  Could you at least get a hat for me?  Seven and five eighths  Why are you shouting?  Yes this is the terrorist bomber.  think I've changed my mind.  What?  I guess it would be nice if you called all the ticket holders          if the game was going to be rained out.  Yeah, that's right.  One second. Hello.  Just lie down.  All right. I'll be right there., Conrad I gotta go.  Ah, back to normal. Not bad for four thousand bucks. . . . I can't          believe I got the Low Fat!  I'm always in traffic with the lane expert. You know this                type of person? Constantly reevaluating their lane choice.. Never                quite sure, "Is this the best lane for  No, of course not.  Everyday.  You tried.  Did you tell her you loved her?  You're a human being.  You're too nice a guy.  You're flesh and blood.  I told you when I met her..  You gotta go to my chiropractor, he's the best.  I'm gonna make an appointment for you. We'll go together.  You should just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion! Right                off!  Hi.  Hello.  No, shower. So, where are we eating?  A relationship is an organism. You created this thing and                then you starved it so it turned against you. Same thing happened                to The Blob.  Hello.. hello. Is Glenn there? I'm sorry. Is this 805-555-3234?..                Yes, I know I have the wrong number. But I just want to know if                I dialed wrong or if..  (Into phone) Oh, it's you again. See? Now if you had answered                me, I wouldn't have had to do this. Now that's too long distance                calls I made to you why  No, I just had a sandwich.  I don't want cantaloupe now.  I only eat cantaloupe at certain times.  Alright.. (tastes it)  It's very good.  Good.  Uh-Huh.  It's too far.  I'm not pulling a shopping cart. What am I suppose to wear?                A kerchief? Put stockings on and roll 'em down below my knee?  I don't return fruit. Fruit is a gamble. I know that going                in.  You did it? What happened?  Ah ha.  See, it's never as bad as you imagine.  Could you stop that smacking?  It's very good cantaloupe. (changing subject) So that's                it? You're out?  So, go get them.  So forget about the books. Did you read them?  What do you need them for?  What is this obsession people have with books? They put                them in their houses - like they're trophies. What do you need it                for after you read it?  So you want me to get those books? Is that it?  So what'd you do?  Well, I have a general idea what it was. I could take a                guess.  No.  (Irritated) I don't know how this happened.  No, no. It's not your fault. Books, books, I need my books.                Have you re-read those books yet, by the way? You know the great                thing? When you read  Ohh.. you know, and sometimes she'll go, "Hello, Jerry?"                and I'll go "Oh, hi Marlene." And then it's "Jerry.."  Ohhhh.. you can't. It's impossible. There's no break in                the conversation where you can go, "Alright, then.. "                You know, it just goes on and on and on with  Yeah. Yes, she is.  Waiting room. I hate when they make you wait in the room.                'Cause it says "Waiting room." There's no chance of not                waiting, 'cause they call it the waiting  So, how was it?  Well, it's a first visit.  You can't do that.  He's a doctor. You gotta pay what he says.  No, I'm fine.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah.  Good night.  Hey.  Alright.  Uh-huh.  That is out there.  No, supermarket.  It's okay.  I'm not taking it back.  I don't care about it.  Alright. Take it back.  (On his answering machine) Leave a message, I'll call you                back.  Marlene  Yeah, I took her home one night - we kinda started up a                little bit in the car.  I was. She's got me, like, hypnotized.  No, he'd go nuts.  I feel terrible. (Kramer smiles) I mean, I've seen her a                couple of times since then, and I know I can't go any further, but..                I've just got this like,  I don't know how I'm going to tell him.  It's partially you, yeah.  Well, he can't kill me, right?  I mean, she called me. I haven't called her. She started                it.  I'm a nice guy.  Oh, my little airplane lamp.  Well, the apartment elevators are always slower than the                offices, because you don't have to be home on time.  Yeah.. because they would be very demanding people.  Well, you know what they say: Luck in love, Unlucky with                fruit.  Really? That guy who stopped saying hello?  You talked to him?  Right.  "You little phony"?  Amazing.  You are the Queen of Confrontation. You're my new hero.                In fact, you've inspired me. I'm gonna call George about something                right now.  You're kidding.  You mean that?  You don't care?  How could you not care?  I thought you'd be upset.  Am I a bad person? Did I do something terrible?  That voice. That voice. She's driving me crazy.  So I can see her tonight, and you don't care?  Alright. As long as you're okay. Because I can't stop thinking                about her.  Good. And I'll tell you what.. You don't have to pay me                back the thirty-five I gave to the chiropractor for the rest of                your bill.  I had to.  It was embarrassing to me.  Why don't you make a point with your own doctor? (George                gulps) What's wrong?  ..So, you want to come up for a few minutes?  Really? I thought..  I guess I just didn't expect it from the way you've been                acting.  Of course I want to talk about it.  Tuesday night? What happened Tuesday night?  My act? What does that have to do with anything?  I can't believe this. So what are you saying? You didn't                like my act, so that's it?  You're a cashier!  You can't go by the audience that night. It was late. They                were terrible.  I have other stuff. You should come see me on the weekend.  Women need to like the job of the guy they're with. If they                don't like the job, they don't like the guy. Men know this. Which                is why we make up the phony  So, does he like you?   You like him?   So, how did you meet him?   So, he's a writer.   Yeah, big surprise.   So, what did you do?   Sounds like a jerk. Felt your material, come on.   What do you think? I found it at the back of my closet.                Hey...   That's Barry Prophet, he's our accountant.   Hey Barry, how you doing? This is my friend George.   Yeah, so how's my money?   What, you got a cold?   Bathroom, bathroom is right over there.   Did you see that?   What was all that sniffing?   You don't think...?   I mean what if, what if, this this guy has got all my money.                Plus he has got some Kramer's money with him. This guy can write                checks to himself right out of my account.   Then, what was all that sniffing?   Today is not cold.   Sniffing, with his nose.   No, I asked him.   I don't know, you know, what if...?   I don't know. All I know he was sniffing.   I know.   Look, it doesn't necessarily mean anything yet, it just                means he was sniffing.   No, he didn't use 'man'.   No, but in one point he did use the bathroom.   Do you think that's a bad sign?   I don't know. This sweater really itches me. You want it?                You're out of your mind you know that.   It's an exclamation point! It's a line with a dot under                it.   A call for one, you know I thought I've heard everything.                I've never heard a relationship being affected by a punctuation.                George was right. Didn't take you long.   Good idea.   Yes, I'd like to speak to Barry Prophet, please.   Out of town?   South America?   I'll call back, thank you. He went to South America!   Who goes to South America?   Yeah, and they come back with things taped to they're large                intestine.   Yes, I'm impugning a continent.   Hello Newman.   Wait a second. Maybe there is someway we can tempt him and                find out...   All right, shut up the both of you! You're making me nervous.                Where is he already? He should've been out of work by now.   Yeah maybe you should.   All right, what are you gonna say to him?   No, you stay in the car.   All right Newman, one more peep out of you and you're out                of the whole operation! There he is. He's going to that bar.   Be careful Kramer.   No, you stay here in the car. I may need you.   I might need you to get me a soda.   You should try this new dental floss Glide, it's fantastic.                You should try this.   Not even once?   You're an idiot.   Right, anyone who uses dental tape is an idiot.   What do you mean you don't like it? How could you not like                it?   'Dear Barry. Consider this letter to be official termination                of our relationship effective immediately.'   'I will expect all funds in form of cashier checks no later                than the 18th'.   Yeah, I'll give you yours as soon as I get my money back.                Yeah, thanks.   You know this...   Hi Ralph.   All right.   Yeah.   Mohair, I think.   You mean you just started sniffing?   I was wearing that sweater in the coffee shop when Barry                came in.   Oh no! The letter, Newman, it's got exclamation points all                over it!   The what??   Sorry I'm late, I just came from a meeting with my lawyer.                It's a letter from your friend Barry Prophet's lawyer.   Bankruptcy, bankruptcy...as in I've taken your money and                spent it on drugs!   What about the money? Apparently if I had dissolved my relationship                with him prior to his filing chapter eleven, I've could've got the                money back. Which I  Think so?   Half silk, half cotton, half linen. How can you go wrong?                My parents live in Florida now. They moved there last year.                They didn't want to move to Floriday, but they're in their sixties,                and that's the law. You know  (Talking about the loud T.V.) Would you make this thing                lower! I can hear it on the street! (Turns it off)  We won. I made an incredible play in the field! There was                a tag-up at third base and I threw the guy out from left field on                a fly! We'll be in the championship  Well, no. Sharon Besser, of course.  Well, the man's an individualist. He worked for Harry Flemming.                He knows what he's doing.  First of all, I made plans with Elaine.  I don't even know them. What is she, your second cousin?                I mean, I've met them three times in my life.  If I wind up sitting nest to Uncle Leo, I am leaving. He's                always grabbing my arm when he talks to me. I guess it's because                so many people have left in the  Hey, he talks about him like he split the atom. The kid                works for the Parks Department.  We won. We're in the finals on Wednesday..  (To Kramer and Morty) What is this about?  What are you doing?  Levels?  You drew up plans for this?  When do you intend to do this?  You're doing this yourself?  Oh, no. It's not that I don't think you can. I know that                you can't, and I'm positive that you won't.  I don't see it happening.  Seriously?  I'll give you a year.  It's a bet. (They both "pinkie swear" to lock                the deal)  Seriously, do you wnat to switch chairs?  Yeah, Uncle Leo.  Right. For reducing the pond scum?  Oh, yeah. Where the people eat the plant life - the edible                foliage tour.  Mickey Mantle?  (Eating a forkful) These peas are bursting with country-fresh                flavor.  Well, actually, we do have to kind of get going.  Yeah, I can't eat dessert either. The sugar makes my ankles                swell up, and I can't dance.  Horses. They're like big riding dogs.  I know, I hated those kids. In fact, I hate anyone that                ever had a pony when they were growing up.  ..Well, I didn't really mean a pony, per se.  Nothing. Nothing at all. I was just merely expressting..  Well, I'm sure you did. Who wouldn't love a pony? Who wouldn't                love a person that had a pony?  No, see, we didn't have ponies. I'm sure at the time in                Poland, they were very common. They were probably like compact cars..  I didn't know she had a pony. How was I to know she had                a pony? Who figures an immigrant's going to have a pony? Do you                know what the odds are on  I'll drive you to the airport.  I just hope that whole pony incident didn't put a damper                on the trip.  Well, if you ever talk to her, tell her I'm sorry. Elaine                too. She feels terrible.  Maybe I will.  (Sarcastically) Really? What a shock.  Take care.  Bye, Dad. Take it easy.  So, when do I get my dinner?  Yes. I know you're not gonna do it. That's why I bet.  That's the bet! That you're not doing it!  We didn't bet on if you wanted to. We bet on if it would                be done.  Well, of course it could be done! Anything could be done!                But it only is done if it's done. Show me the levels! The bet is                the levels.  That's the bet! (Phone rings, Jerry answers it) Hello? ..No,                oh, hi.. no, they just left.. Oh my God.. hand on a second. Maybe                I can still catch them. (Jerry  Uncle Leo.  I don't know. He said he'd call back.  What?  You don't think.. What? The pony remark?  You don't think that I killed her?  It was just an innocent comment! I didn't know she had a                pony!  The whole thing ws taking out of context. It was a joke.                (Phone rings) That's probably Uncle Leo.  Wednesday? What, what Wednesday?  I've got the softball game on Wednesday. It's the championship.  I didn't even know the woman.  I mean I met her three times. I don't know her last name.  I mean, who has a funeral on a Wednesday? That's what I                want to know. I mean, it's the championship. I'm hitting everything.  I don't know what to do.  We don't understand death. And the proof of this is that                we give dead people a pillow. And, uh, I mean, hey, you know. I                think if you can't stretch out and  Two Forty-Five.  Two o' clock.  Depends on how nice the person was. But you gotta figure,                even Oswald took forty-five minutes.  You know, if the situation were reversed and Manya had some                mah-jongg championship or something, I wouldn't expect her to go                to my funeral. I would  I know, and then you say to yourself, "From this moment                on, I'm not going to waste any more of it." But then you go,                "How? What can I do that's not  Me? What about you? You brought up the pony.  Bender.  Fifty years they were married. Now he's moving to Pheonix.  I don't know. They've been in there since, like, World War                II. The rent's three hundred a month.  (Looking at his watch) Well, the game's starting just about                now.  (To Isaac) I just wanted to say how sorry I was..  (To Isaac) Once again, I just want to say how sorry I am                abou tthe other night.  (To Elaine) You know Jeffery?  (Moves to the window) It's raining? It's raining. The game                will be postponed. We'll play tomarrow.  It's never happend to me before.  I'll have to live with this shame for the rest of my life.  I thought there were two outs.  It was the single worst moment of my life.  Oh, well, of course. 1973.  Wonder about what?  You think Manya showed up during the game and put a hex                on me?  But I went ot the funeral.  Don't you think she would've heard I was there?  Who figures and immigrant's gonna have a pony?  What is the pony? What is the point of the pony? Why do                we have these animals, these ponies? What do we do with them? Besides                the pony ride. Why  What time does your flight get in? Six? All right, that                gives us six hours. Then I'll meet you at the diplomat's club. I'll                be the one without the big red sash. Okay, see you tonight. (Hangs                up)  Yep, she's not gonna be back for a month, but I got six                hours.  I do, but it's three o'clock and then I'm flying right back                and meeting Bridget at the Diplomat's Club in the airport.  So that's it? You know I never even met the guy.   You're marchin' in.  Hey. Elaine's quitting.  How 'bout the march out?  Get a march goin'! March it! (She exits)  Why?  What for?  Isn't putting this guy's picture on your desk a little transparent?  Maybe he looks a little like Sugar Ray Leonard.  Well, you still shouldn't have said it.  Maybe.  You'd have marched on Great Neck?  Hey, there you are.  He's taking me to the airport. But we've got a few minutes.  This is it. I'm only going for the day. I just gotta drop by the  Hey wait a second, what are you doing? You're not betting.You  Kramer, you've had this thing under control for almost three  No!  What're you doing about Morgan?  Yeah except you don't really have any black friends. Outside of  That's great. You know what? Leave it. Just pull the car around  Yeah. I'll take care of it. Just throw that in there, would you?  Take an antihistamine.They're over there.  Yeah, they're great.  I just saw them. Oh, here. Here you go.  Have a good day, sir.  I don't see Katie anywhere.  No, she's this woman who's booking me on these college  Oh, hi, Katie.  Yes, I followed the planes.  Thanks. Thanks for telling me.  Yes, I know. I've flown before.  No.  I don't care.  Who?  I don't care, why are you telling me this?  Why would I freak out? (To himself) Pilot...  Hey, all right. Good afternoon Ithaca. Welcome, good to                see you here... Boy, I'll tell you, there's an awful lot of those                orange cones you have on the throughway... (Sees pilot) on the way...                up here... um... I..  No, it didn't. And you know why? Seeing the pilot in the                audience really freaked me out.  If you hadn't mentioned anything, I would have been fine.                I became obsessed with him.  Oh, it doesn't matter now.  Yeah, you're on top of it, and I'm on the bottom!  (To Katie) What is the complication?  Yes?  What?  I didn't care.  He can't just throw me off the plane!  But I'm not a disturbance!  But someone is waiting for me!  I'm freakin' out! I am freakin' out!  Which one do you think I want?  Then we'll make it the eight.  Hotel?  No, no, no. I have to get home tonight. Bridget's gonna                be waiting for me at the Diplomat's Club. Rent a car.  I don't have a preference, okay! Just make a decision yourself!                Stop bothering me with every minor little detail, please?  George.  I'm still here. Listen, you gotta go down to the Diplomat's                Club...  Carl, I think.  Yeah, he was nice.  Defent.  You need an exterminator?  Oh, don't tell me. 'Cause he's black?  George, George!  Hello, this is Jerry Seinfeld. Is Elaine there?  Elaine, I need you to do me a big favor. I need you to go                down to the Diplomat's Club and meet Bridget for me. I'm going to                be late.  Right, I don't want Bridget to think I stood her up. I'll                never get another date with her. She'll freak out.  I am a little freaked out!  All right, but you have to go now.  (Wakes up) Where are we?  Is this even a road?  What? Why didn't you wake me up?  No, road is a major detail!  (Pointing ahead) Look out!  That's it! No more questions! I don't care!  Bridget!  Oh, I'm so sorry. I got stuck out of town. I missed our                whole time together.  Really? (They start to make out, Jerry sees the pilot on                the plane) Oh my God, that's him! That's the pilot!  You know their timing couldn't be worse.  You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for          like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm          getting a little uh backed up.   Not for another three days.  She lives with her parents.  (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will          all be turning your way.   The baldies  That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night.          You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.  Hey Alec  What happened?  (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone          like me? Please?  Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy          now?  Ya, it's much better isn't it?  Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one          of those French-English   What?  Yea?  What about little Joey?  Ah, I think he's probably better off.  He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.   Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.  Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you          could get some there.  (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?   Where'd you get plans?  (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.  So what plans do you have?  So how come you're not going over there for dinner?  Really? Since when?  Why?  No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you          could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.   Ya?  U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a          problem with her do you?  She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.  He's nice, bit of a close talker.  You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about          the Costanzas'  No I haven't.  I'm swamped.  Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.  Ok buh bye. Have a good time.  Ok.  I don't know.  Maybe he was just trying to be nice.  Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.  (dialing) He got em out of the house.  Call Rachel.  (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?!          I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel!          (hangs up the phone very disappointed)   (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.  Oh sure like Monet.  Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet,          Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.  (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.  Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs          phone up)  Bye  The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.  This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.  N-na I'm paying for the trip.  He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that          never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.  Ah come on.  No I haven't seen it yet.  I'm going  Ok  Well, I painted my apartment again. I've been living in                this apartment for years and years, and every time I paint it, it                kinda gets me down. I look around,  What did you do?  Oh, look, its so subjective.  Maybe.  Harold and Manny.  Boys, boys.  I slid the rent under your door, Harold. Did you get it?  She died? ..Mrs. Hudwalker died?  Are you kidding? You know my friend Elaine?  It's not promised to anybody? 'Cause she would take it in                a second.  So, it's okay? I could just tell her she can have it?  Oh, nothing important.  What look? Nothing.  I don't know if you should sit for this or not. Sitting                is good if you faint, but standing is good for jumping up and down..                I can't decide.  Oh, Elaine. You know the way I am - rarely ever thinking                of myself. My only concern is the welfare and happiness of those                close to me. Sure, it hurts  What would you say if I told you that..  ..I got you an apartment in this building.  Yes.  Yes.  I did.  I got you an apartment in the building.  Remember Mrs. Hudwalker? The ninety-four-year-old woman                who lived above me?  She died.  She died.  And the rent's only four hundred dollars a month!  Four hundred a month.  Right upstairs.  Right above me.  (Suddenly having second thoughts) All the time..  ..All the time..  The problem with talking is that nobody stops you from saying                the wrong thing. I think life would be a lot better if it was like                you're always making a movie.  You can't believe what I just did.  I could tell you what I did, but you wouldn't believe it.                It's not believable.  How could I have done that?  I told Elaine about an apartment opening up in my building.                She's going to move in.  Yes. Right above me.  Yes.  I know. Neighbors.  Right above me.  'Cause I'm an idiot! You may think you're an idiot, but                with all due respect - I'm a much bigger idiot than you are.  Did you ever ask an ex-girlfriend to move into your building?  She's right in my building! Right above me! Every time I                come in the building, I'm gonna have to sneak around like a cat                burglar.  But I need the home bed advantage!  (Gesturing to the coffee shop) Come in for two minutes and                sit with me.  Oh, who's gonna know?  Two minutes.  My censoring system broke down. You know that little guy                in your head who watches everything you say? Makes sure you don't                make a mistake? He went  ..So, is there any way out of this Elaine thing?  You know, the water pressure's terrible in my building..                and she loves a good shower.  If they were fanatic about showers, they might.  Look at that woman feeding her baby greasy, disgusting,                coffee shop corned beef hash. Isn't that child abuse?  Yeah, the guy with the flat head?  Yeah, I've heard that about wedding bands.  That would be an interesting sociological experiment. You                know, Kramer has his father's band. He'd loan it to you.  Boys, boys.  What?  Hey, hey. I understand. You're businessmen. (Manny talks                in Spanish)  Well, that's a lot of money. But, if that's the way it's                gotta be, that's the way it's gotta be. (Goes back to his apartment)                You know, I used to think that the  Religion, my friend, that's what happened to me. Because,                I have just been informed that it's going to cost Elaine the sum                of five thousand dollars to get the  Of course she doesn't have five thousand dollars!  Can't get it.  No move. So, you see, it's all part of a divine plan.  (Into the intercom) Elaine?  (Unlocks the main door. To George) Alright, this is going                to require some great acting now. I have to pretend I'm disappointed.                You're going to really see  'Cause you know, I love Elaine.  But you know.. not in the building. Really, I feel terrible                about this. My intentions were good. What can I do? Tell me..  (Looks at the checks) Well.. there's a little bit of a problem.  No, someone offered Harold and Manny five thousand for the                apartment. I'm sure they'd just as soon give it to you, but you'd                have to come up with that  I know.  I have no idea.  Yeah, well, I didn't.. Is that something you want to borrow?  She doesn't want to borrow the money.  Who said there's a problem?  It was all over! Taken care of. Done! Finished. Five thousand..                Where's she gonna get five thousand? She doesn't have five thousand.                Clean. Good bye.  No, I didn't!  People don't turn down money! It's what separates us from                the animals.  Let me explain something to you.. You see, you're not normal.                You're a great guy, I love you, but you're a pod. I, on the other                hand, am a human being. I  Yeah, it's my life's work.  Well, better load up on some carbos before the race. (Starts                selecting food from the tables)  Oh, yes. Particularily if your not in it.  What's to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya, and                twenty thousand losers.  Fantastic..  I know.  It's tremendous.  I'm in heaven.  Oh, I wouldn't quite say that.  I'm a guy.. it always looks like that.  Na..  You have no idea what an idiot it. Elaine just gave me a                chance to get out and I didn't take it. (Points to himself) This                is an idiot.  (Into the phone) George, I didn't sleep at all last night..                I decided I have to tell her.. I'm just going to be honest. That's                all.. Yes, I'm nervous.. Are you  What? What's cool?  What are you talking about?  You what?! Get out! Ten thousand?  Who would pay that much?  Elaine would never borrow that much money! (Hugs Kramer,                then grabs him by the cheeks) Kramer, my God, man! This is beautiful!                I think I'm in the clear  It's just unbelievable.  All the time. I've been up there six times. They refuse                to stop. I can't live like this. I don't know what I'm gonna do.                I'm heading for breakdown! (To Harold)  Manny..  I don't know. What do you do when a neighbor is making,                like, a lot of noise at three o' clock in the morning? I mean, can                you knock on someone's door  I never get enough sleep. I stay up late at night, cause I'm Night Guy.                  Night Guy wants to stay up late. 'What about getting up after five hours sleep?',                  oh that's Morning Guy's problem. That's not my problem, I'm Night Guy. I stay                  up as late as I want. So you get up in the morning, you're ..... (?), you're                  exhausted, groggy, oooh I hate that Night Guy! See, Night Guy always screws                  Morning Guy. There's nothing Morning Guy can do. The only Morning Guy can do                  is try and oversleep often enough so that Day Guy looses his job and Night Guy                  has no money to go out anymore.  No. You?  Yeah.  Hey.  You got me the air conditioner?  Beautiful!  Is it a good one?  Commando 8?  All right.  Yeah.  So you're tunneling to the center of the Earth?  He was running from a bee.  There's a lot of change down there.  We're behind you, Aquaboy. Godspeed!  Hey, he just got me thirty percent off on an air conditioner.  Come on, George. Pick a face and go with it!  (While looking at posters of women wearing glasses:) I think these women                  would be pretty good looking if they weren't wearing glasses.  Are you okay? Did he bite you?  Oh I'm gonna take you over to the emergency room.  (To George:) Hey, any luck? Did you catch 'em?  All right, I'm gonna take Elaine over to the hospital.  What's the matter?  What is it?  Yeah, yeah, in a second, in a second. (And to George:) What do you mean                  you can't tell me?  I'm asking!  Yeah, yeah, take care.  Come on, George, what is it?  What?  Amy and Jeffrey?  Are you sure?  But you can't see, there's no lenses in those frames.  We're gonna have to talk about this later.  Thank you. Taxi!  Why not? They could have met. She loves the park, he works for the Parks                  Department.   But he was squinting.  Are you kidding? I've seen 'em squint. He can squint his way down to                  like twenty, thirty vision. Once we were driving down from the Catskills and                  he lost his glasses. He squinted his way from Wortsborough down to the Tappan                  Zee Bridge! He was spotting raccoons, on the road!   Now, look at this. Cable's out.  No, no, no. No trouble at all, it's a principal the thing.   I like them to know that I know what's going on. That they're not...                  getting away with anything. Oh, I'm on hold. So, what did you do yesterday?  Yeah, you remember yesterday? Beautiful day... good day to be... out.  Oh you must have done something.  Didn't go out of the house? Didn't take a walk... on Columbus Avenue?  Well, your day's getting more interesting already.  Ah, see, told me they'd be back in a minute and THEY lied.  No you can't. Now let's cut the ball, sister! You think I don't know                  about you swapping spit with somebody yesterday on Columbus Avenue?  Look, my friend saw you.  You tell me.  There isn't?  Oh... all right... wanna get some pizza?  Why?  No, no, there's no side!  No, no, no ugly side.  Why?  Uuh, so we can still go out on Friday though?  It's coming! It's a Commando 8! 12.000 BTU's! It's gonna be like a meat                  locker in here.  I was an idiot for listening to you!  Ooh, everything was going so well. She hadn't seen any flaws in me.                  Now she sees a side.   A bad side, an ugly side.   So what? I wasn't planning on showing that side for another six months.                  Now you make me throw off the whole learning curve.  Ah, he'd just deny it.  Amy said nothing happened.  Yeah, but you're blind as a bat!  They were mailboxes, you idiot. I didn't have the heart to tell you.  (Stunned:) No, keep it.  Hey what happened to you? You buzzed five minutes ago.  A little white dog?   Snowball? You were afraid of Snowball?  He's like a squirrel.  You know, you should just go back to the optical store and ask Dwayne                  if he knows the name of the owner of the dog.  Hey, Kramer, Elaine's afraid of Snowball!  I don't know what to believe! You're eating unions, you're spotting                  dimes, I don't know what the hell is going on.  Hey wait a second, wait a second. I'm going over to Jeffrey's apartment                  tomorrow night to pick up these Paul Simon tickets. I'm gonna surprise Amy.                  All I gotta do is bring her with me. And then when Jeffrey opens the door, it's                  Howdy Doody time.  I don't know what to tell you, Elton.  (To George:) Who picked these out?  They're ladies' glasses! All you need is that little chain around your                  neck so you can wear 'em while you're playing Canasta.  Hey, hey.  Take it to the window.  Just in time for Amy.  Rabies.  Hey, hey, what is this? What's going on here?  Oh he'll be home, it's Friday night. That's the big night on the Nature                  Channel.  He does look like a horse.   Hey, shall we spit on him?  Oh, you'll find out.  Well, I'm very mysterious by nature.  A lot of women find that attractive.  Really?  Uncle Leo!  This is Amy.  Unlce Leo, what are you doing here?  Ooh! Very convenient.  Oh really?  Uncle Leo! Did he leave any tickets here for me?  Thank you.  To the Paul Simon concert in the park!  That's right, lady!  I thought you'd like that.  Now you know. That, and that alone, is the reason.  Thank you.  (To Amy:) Aha! So it's true! You were making out with him!  Oh very convincing, but it's not gonna work this time.  Oh... oh... wanna get some pizza?  I still don't know how you spotted that dime. I think you planted it.                  Plus I've got to pay that vet bill for the stupid dog. I don't know how that                  guy got my name.  Holland *is* the Netherlands.  I told you, we should have taken some kind of vacation.  Because you said this would be better. Remember? A vacation                from  No.  Stop it, George. Stop it. I'm sorry, you've gotta get a                job.  No more crutches, that must be a relief.  Not with a cane?  Always a sad story. Hey, you should have been here tonight.                Some guy  We? No.  Killed?  Because I killed first and warmed up the crowd. He's like                that fish  Yeah, I'm the shark and he's the fish eating my laughs.  Well, I'm glad I brought it up.  What?  So what's this job?  Knicks? Rangers?  Welcome back to the show.  No.  What kind do you use?  Remember David Puddy?  Well, I guess she's batted around and she's back at the                top of the  Oh, I'm taking this lace out. It came undone and touched                the floor of a  He killed. He only does well when he has me for a lead-in.                He's a time  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.  Do I have to ask?  Why are you buttering your face?  Oh Moses smell the roses.  No.  I don't want to.  You got the job?  Hold on, they think you're handicapped?  How can you do this?  He drove a car with no arms?  Do you know how hard it's getting just to tell people I                know you?  You can eat it?  Oh my god, it's Bania and Jenna.  The tooth brush in the toilet bowl.  I don't believe this.  No! He's riding my coattails again. He's getting everything                off me,  Someone's cooking.  Hello, Newman.  No, he's up on the roof getting some sun with the butter                - pause - Oh  Kramer!  Look at your skin.  Technically, you're sauted. So, what are you doing for                that?  Is that what the doctor said?  Kind of. Nice limp, you're bringing your work home with                you?  What happened?  Oh no, not you too?  You know what's good for that? Relish.  Hello? Yeah, this is Jerry Seinfeld. What? No. No! No! No!!                No!!!   Like what, Ovaltine? Why do dogs drink out of the toilet?                Shopping  You think that's funny?  You like Bania's act. You're a closet Bania fan!  Oh, I'm gonna puke.  You mugged Stephen Hawking?  Well it must be comforting to know you'll be going straight                to hell at  Hello?  Hey, Lainie, how's the trip going?  Who's that?  Who?  Get me some duty free Kahlua.  Sounded good.  Hey, if you got any juice left, you might wanna roll by                the big showcase  That's right, and I'll tell you what. I'm feeling a little                off.  That's right, I'm taking a dive.  I'm laying down! Then let's see how he does up there, without                all the  We're four months apart.  That's right, Choochie. Let's see how Bania does without                the cushy  If you'll excuse me.  What's the deal with lampshades? I mean if it's a lamp,                why do you want  And what's with people getting sick?  I mean, what's the deal with cancer?  What are you talking about? I bombed!  Like who?  He had cancer!  Hey, sorry Kenny. Guess you got your work cut out for you.  Ah, the sweet stench of failure.  Ouch.  What?  Oh, I'm gonna puke.  Most men like working on things, tools, objects,                fixing things. This is what men enjoy doing. Have you ever noticed                a guy's out in his driveway working on  I don't think you did anything wrong.  We can only thank God for that.  You're imagining this. Really.  What floss? When?  Ah, mint.  So let me get this straight: she saw the floss,                you panicked and you told her you liked her.  And you're sure the floss was the catalyst?  (looks at a carrying pouch George is wearing)                You don't think it might've had anything to do with that?  It looks like your belt is digesting a small                animal.  (to Kramer) Who is it?  Who is it?  (into phone) Hello? Oh, hi Joel. (Jerry hits                Kramer with a magazine.) .. No. I was out of town. I just got back..                Kramer doesn't know anything.. He's just  Maybe I didn't want to talk to him.  He bothers me. I don't even answer the phone                anymore because of him. He's turned me into a screener. Now I gotta                go see him on Wednesday.  We're going. That's next Wednesday.  His name is Joel Horneck. He lived like three                houses down from me when I grew up. He had a Ping Pong table. We                were friends. Should I suffer the rest of  Can you conduct your business elsewhere?  I don't bother with him. He's been calling                me for seven years. I've never called him once! He's got the attention                span of a five-year-old. Sometimes I sit  What can I do? Break up with him? Tell him                "I Don't think we're right for each other.." He's a guy.                At least with a woman, there's a precendent. You know,  Just break up with him?  As a guy I don't know how I can break up with                another guy. You know what I mean? I don't know how to say, "Bill,                I feel I need to see other men." Do  You know, I read the Lenny Bruce biography,                I thought it was really - interesting.. he would-  (testing Joel) So, I'm thinking about going                to Iran this summer.  Anyway, the Hizballah has invited me to perform.                You know, it's their annual terrorist luncheon. I'm gonna do it                is Farsi.  Yeah, I'll have the egg salad on whole wheat.  How can you talk to someone like that?  Listen, Joel. There's something I have to tell                you.  ..listen, Joel.. I don't think we should see                each other anymore.  This friendship.. it's not working.  We're just not suited to be friends.  Look, you're a nice guy, it's just that - we                don't have anything in common.  You didn't do anything. It's not you, it's                me. It's.. this is very difficult.  No, it's not that.  Oh, come on. That's not true.  I know, I know.  Best friend? I've never been to your apartment.  Okay, okay. Forget it. It's okay. Id didn't                mean it.  What I said. I've been under a lot of stress.  Just, can we just forget the whole thing ever                happend? I'm sorry. I din't mean it. I took it out on you. We're                still friends. We're still friends. Still friends.  No, next Wednesday. If it was tonight, I would've                said tonight.  (faking) Yes.  Next Wednesday.  Uh, the four worst words in the English language.  That is worse.  Really.  Hm? You ate.  Someone says, "Get out of my life!"                and that doesn't affect your appetite?  It is unbelievable.  (looking at George's penny jug) How much could                you possibly have in there? GEORGE: It's my money. What should I                do? Throw it out the window? I  Yeah? Where'd he go? To and arcade?  C'mon, move up.  Oh, God.  Listen, George, little problem with the game.  The thing is, yesterday, I kind of.. uh..  I geve your ticket to Horneck.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I had to give it to Horneck.  (talking about the line) C'mon, c'mon, go ahead,                move up.  You didn't see him. It was horrible.  I had to do it.  Do you want to go with him? You go. I don't                mind.  I do not like the bank. I've heard the expression                "Laughing all the way to the bank." I have never seen                anyone actually doing it. And those bank lines. I hate  George.  Could you stop the counting?  Can I make it up to you? I'll give you fifty                bucks for the jug.  Well, then I'm not going to the game either.                Okay? I'll give him both tickets.  I.. no, I don't want to go.  I had to give him a tissue. In fact, let me                call his machine now and I'll just make up some excuse why I can't                go to the game either.  George, the man wept.  I have to say something. With all due respect,                I just never.. I can't imagine anyone in any walk of life, under                any circumstance, wanting to make their own  I'm just saying..  Okay.  Hi, Joel. This is Jerry. I hope you get this                before you - Oh, Hi. Joel.. oh, you just came in.. listen, I can't                amke it to the game tonight. I, uh, have to tutor my  I know. I'm really running out of excuses with                this guy. I need some kind of excuse Rolodex.  Okay.  Where do you want to go?  We could go to one of those cappuccino places.                They let you just sit there.  Okay, just ahnd that over, please.  It's a list of excuses, it's for that guy,                Horneck, who's at the game tonight with my tickets. I have that                list now so in case he calls, I just consult it and i don't  I don't need anymore.  (sarcastic) Very funny.  I'm Dan. Can I have my list back, please?  What can I do?  Oh no. That's impossible. I'd rather lie to                him for the rest of my life that go through that again. He was crying,                tears accompanied by mucus.  A couple of touch monkeys.  Game?  Wait. How does Horneck know you?  This is too much.  Oh, no.  Perfect.  Oh, we finished early.  Elaine Benes, this is Joel Horneck.  We're still friends.  Right. I forgot about choir.  Right. You know, the wall being down and everything.  You really should.  You know, I really.. I've come to the conclusion                that there are certain friends in you life that they're just always                your friends and you have to accept it. You  So youre                staying at Play Now?  But they                not you arent handicapped, arent you ashamed?  Oh, its                just this stupid thing.   (doing                the voice) No-o-o-o.  All right.                You know this girl Clare I am seeing?   Well, he                and I starting joking that when she falls asleep her stomach stays                awake all night and talks to me.  Well, her                belly button is like a mouth. (doing the voice) Im bored.                Talk to me.  Hey, look                whose here - Puddy.   And yet                he continues to live.  Well, thats                it. You two are back together.  The bump                into. The bump into always leads to the backslide.  Elaine,                breaking up is like knocking over a coke machine. You cant                do it in one push, you got to rock it back and forth a few times,                and then it goes over.  Thats                different. I didnt have feelings for those people. But you,                youll backslide  Stakes?  Dollars?  Done.  Yeah.  I went                to the movies last night, I went to the bathroom and I unbuckled                a little wobbly and the buckle kind of banged against the side of                the urinal. So(throws away belt) thats it!  Oh yes,                quite.  Of course                its a sliding scale.  (doing                the voice) La la la.  Oh, that                restaurant on top of the Chrysler building? Yeah, thats a                good idea.  Which part?                The renovating the restaurant you dont own part or spending                the two hundred million you dont have part?  No resources,                no skill, no talent, no ability, no brains.  I can ball                park it.  Hey, I                called you last night, where were you?  George?  Well, I                was here, thats everyone (laughing).  Are those                the same shoes as yesterday?  Your hair,                its somewhat de-poofed.   Wait a                second, whats going on here?  (screams).  Youre                wearing the same clothes as yesterday!!! (pauses) You saw Puddy!  Hand it                over. Pay up.  Then what                do you call it? People dont just bump into each other and                have sex. This isnt cinemax.  Ah, dinner!                Thats it, youre all the way back!  Sex, thats                meaningless, I can understand that, but dinner; thats heavy.                Thats like an hour.  And you                are?  Whos                he?   Alright.  But you                only provide fantasy world corporate experience.  Alright,                its time to go.   (sarcastically)                I know!  Actually,                that is not a bad idea.  Now, its                time to go.  Hello  (doing                the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (pauses) So, whats going on?  So, are                you going to leave?  I thought                youre like Hitler in the bunker?  Im                getting a little uncomfortable with the Hitler stuff. (his other                line beeps) Im getting another call, see ya(answers                call) Hello!  (looking                shocked) Really? When?  No, I dont.  Hey! So,                wheres my money?  Oh yeah,                hold on.  Hello Darren,                this is Jerry from Jerrys office. (Elaine is looking confused).                Were going to be three for lunch. (Elaine is still looking                confused) What do you mean hes already left?  Hey, Elaine                is going to come with us, alright?  Well, just  Do you                have to write   So, how                hot did it get?  I guess                you can take anything, but actual work.  (doing                the voice) Wel-l-l-c-o-m-e!  Oh that                makes a lot of sense.  (giggling)  Oh, nothing.                (still giggling)  Oh all                right, this is really dumb, really stupid. Weve been doing                this silly, dumb voice.  No, its                not you. Its your stomach, hes taking with this funny,                booming, jovial voice. (doing the voice) Hello-o-o-o.  No its  Hey, were                kind of in the middle of something here. Would you mind coming back                later?  (Screams)                GET OUT!  No body                said youre fat. Hes a loving character, like the Kool-ade                guy.  No, hes                just a little bloated.  Its                mostly water weight.  Line two?  Oh  So youre                sure youre not still angry about last night?  Never?  What about                if youre not around?  So I have                to choose between seeing you and doing the voice?  I can do                that.  I dont                know.  (doing                the voice) Hello-o-o-o. La-la-la. (haha)  So we could                do the voice. (doing the voice) La-la-la. Whats the matter?  No, it    Really?  (doing                the voice) Hello-o-o-o.  See, never                bet against the backslide. I knew you two would get back together.  No, I dont                think so. Ive seen you two together. You make each other miserable.                Its kismet.  Done.  Youre                in there again.   What is                this? (Kramer is wearing jeans that look like it doesnt fit                him).  Yeah. Nine                oclock.  (doing                the voice) Good-bye Kramer.  Really?  (on the                phone with Clare) Clare thanks for giving me a second chance. Our                relationship is certainly worth more than some silly, stupid voice.                Hold on one second. (George walks in  Jerry asks George) So                we definitely dont want to do the voice anymore? (George shakes                his head NO) Alright, were back together again, great. Bye                bye.  Trouble                down at the plant?  I understand                (not really understanding, lol).  Youre                not  Go again?  Ha ha ha.                Ha ha ha ha.   They got                away.  Hey.  Yeah, I                put a six hour tape in. That should cover the experiment, the arrest,                and most of your trial. Alright, Ill see ya.  I cant.                I got to meet Clare.  Yeah, I                thought it was stupid. Unless you guys are liking it again.  Darren?  Uh, bathroom.  I thought                it was open to the public.  Wow! Zanadu                . No wonder youre putting in so many hours. (looks at urinal)                May I?  Wow! Hey,                theres Clare. I better go down.  Theres                the giant ball of oil. Clares right underneath that thing.                Clare! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o! Hello-o-o-o!  This is                going to be a shame.  Clare won                her lawsuit against Play Now. Gee, Play Now is filing for bankruptcy.                I guess youre not going in anymore.   So theyre                not paying you your  So youre                pretty much  What ever                happened to Darren?  So Clare                sure looked real funny covered in oil like that (doing the                voice) Hello-o-o-o I got beamed with a giant ball of oil  Im                just so glad its back.  It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting,          the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit          down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come          in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work.          People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I          don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll          tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it.          Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then          our brains will work.  I know what you mean.  It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.  Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.  So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?  To see a movie.  Not this movie.  Did you shower today?  That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.  Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.  What is that?  Ey, ey!  Nothing.  Have a good time.  You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?  Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?  Faux pas.  You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't         want to take up any of my   It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.  It's pompous.  Hey - hey - hey!  Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an         open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.  Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.         We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.  Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?         Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,  He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about         "Jerry."  Right.  Yeah!  Today, like right now.  "Jerry"!  He wants to talk about "Jerry"!  "Jerry"!  Sure!  Forget the sports jacket.  You're not a writer.  Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.  Don't blow this.  If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.  He might not want nothing.  He might want a show about anything and everything.  All right.  What?  Good, good. You remember George.  Don't spell.  Shut up, George.  Oy.  Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to         talk about it, right?  Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than         "coffee machine show."  But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.  He's a little off the wall.  Definitely.  Yeah!  Hi. Elaine, it's me.  No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.  The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to   Did you hear what I said?  Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?  So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone         walk-and-talk.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's         fantastic! Thanks. Great.   Hey - how was the beach?  I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?  So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well,         the new guy at NBC wants to do it.   Yeah, only for a while.  No, I'll be back.  And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go         somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.  Anywhere.  I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their         shelf for five years.  Russia, it's so bleak.  It's still bleak.  You can be bleak in spring.  Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to         agree on anything.   So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.  Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that         conversation.  First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting         face-off, now you're talking about  Hello, Newman. What gives?  Yeah, that's right.  Really.  That's a shame.  Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!  Yeah.  All set. We'll just grab the bags.  Just keeps on getting better and better.  Not bad.  You're complaining about a private jet?  Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.  You're not writing any letters!  Still got water in your ear?  Kramer, what the hell did you do?  Kramer!  Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.  Yeah.  What? What is it?  What?  Why?  Great - I won.  Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.  Alright.  We're straightening out!  Where are we?  Okay.  We'll see you later.  I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.  Alright, I'll feel him out.  Another one?  Well, there goes the money for the lipo.  That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.  Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.  No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat         in Sticksville.  Under arrest? What for?  Oh, yeah.  But then we would have missed the whole thing.  I forgot about the video.  Plane's ready.  You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to         at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't         even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.  It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  Good morning.  No.  This one?  Do I have to?  Yeah.  Well, there goes the money for the lipo.  Gimme that rye.  I want that rye lady.  Shut up, you old bag!  The virgin!  Who the hell is that?  That's right, the Bubble Boy.  He's a boy who lives in a bubble.  Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.  Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.  Who?  Medium crab bisque.  Just forget it. Let it go.  How did they find Babu?  Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?  It's not that bright orange one is it?  Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was         going down?  Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.  What?  Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then         we'll be back  Sure.  I think that would be a very nice gesture.  See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.  Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the         shirt. Look at it, it's   You think?  Yeah, maybe we have.  So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me         to play in the yard. But of   I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in         Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?  Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding         sir - lighten up. How about   Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.  Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of         your hand.  Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.  What's with the age gap hiring policy at most movie theaters?                Didja   You don't understand. I got this all timed out. I got another                And I'm doin' Letterman Monday. You know, I gotta work out                the   No, I'm supposed to meet my friends to see this movie ``CheckMate''  [not losing a step] Heeeeyyyyyyyy..... [and out the door]  What are <you> doing here?  [to taxi driver] Take the Park!  [rubbing his eyes hoping the nightmare will end]  That's very nice of you, but I can't do the voices.  I gotta get out of this cab...  No, I'm not riffing. I'm ignoring! Do you understand the                Your trench coat in my closet?  No thanks, maybe some other time.  No, I don't.  No. No. I was kidding. It's terrible.  Hi, I got some friends inside, I gotta get a message to                'em.  44th and 9th.  No.  Gasoline? Can't you get it after you drop me off?  Hey, did I make it?  Oh, great. That's great. What a night.  You got my spot?  Really...  Weight? Naw. Just need some more height.  My whole night's ruined.  ``Rochelle Rochelle'', huh?  [his interest piqued] Minsk?  Elaine?  Elaine!  George?  Hey, where's Kramer?  Let's get outta here. [to Buckles] I'll see ya.  Yeah.  I don't want the coat.  I didn't even use the ticket!  I only have a twenty.  I always get confused in the movie theater by the, by the                plot.  First it was the health club, then the supermarket, now                the bookstore. They could put it anywhere they want, no one's meetin'                anybody.  (Sarcastic) You better hurry.  (Sarcastic) Yes. The city needs more slow-moving wicker                vehicles.  She's at that annual Peterman party tonight. You know the                one she danced at last year?  (Pointing) Hey, there's Leo.  Uncle Leo.  Did I just see that?!  (Sarcastic) Yeah. I understand Guttenberg used to spend                a lot of time in there.  (Reading the cover of the book George was forced to buy)                'French Impressionist Paintings'?  (Cutting him off) Thank you very much.  I can't. I'm meeting Uncle Leo. I saw him shoplifting at                the bookstore.  Sleeping in the caragain?  (Remembering) Oh, right. The big party..  (Rubbing it in) Ah, the drunken make-out. An office classic.                Did you end up xeroxing anything?  (Confused) What's your position?  (Jokingly rubbing it in) As opposed to a spirited bout of                Skanko-Roman wrestling.  (Sarcastic) Oh, hey. Can I fix you fellas some drinks and                sandwiches?  (Jokingly trying to be skeptical) No, you're not.  (Still skeptical) No, he doesn't.  Yes, it can.  So, who's gonna pull this thing?  (Extremely happy about Kramer and Newman's dilemma) My,                isn't this an awkward moment?  (Sarcastic) Now, that's the first sensible idea I've heard                all day.  So, Leo, how's everything? You doin' Okay?  (Shrugging his problems off) Yeah, yeah. But what about                money? Are you strapped? Do you need a little?  (Being frank) Leo, I saw you in Brentano's yesterday.  Because you were too busy stealing a book.  (Showing that it's a problem) Leo, I saw you steal.  Who, criminals?  You could get arrested.  (Pleading) Leo..  (Thinking he's stopped Leo's thefts) Thank you.  (To himself) I don't believe this! (Walks over to a security                guard) Excuse me, I wonder if you could do me a favor? My uncle's                having a little problem with  (Pointing) He's over there in the overcoat. If you could                just kind of put a scare into him.. You know, set him straight..  '51-50'? That - that's just a scare, right?  (To Guard) I just wanted you to scare him.  (Unsure of what to say - he remember's Leo's courtesy tip)                Hello?  Mom, I didn't rat out Uncle Leo. I just wanted the guard                to scare him straight.  (Scoffing) Prison. I'm sure it's just a fine.  (Not believeing it) Prior convictions? Leo?  (Confused) What does that mean?  (Shocked at his parents) You're stealing too?!  Mom, you too?  Alright, I'll talk to you later.  (Joking around) Well, you know, eighty-five percent of all                homeless rickshaw businesses fail within the first three months.  To the Idiotmobile!  So, even though you're not really going out with this guy,                he's cheating on you?  (Butting in) Tina Turner?  Is it so horrible to have to keep a book?  (Stern on George) Not underpants.  (Getting up) Uncle Leo. Hello!  (Trying to explain) Uncle Leo, I'm sorry. I didn't know                about your.. past.  (Following Leo out the door) Uncle Leo, wait! Hello?!  Leo's furious. (He stops in his tracks when he sees Elaine                looking at George's book) What is that doing on the table?  (Pointing) I'm not eating anything in the vicinity of that                book.  That book has been on a wild ride. George took it into the                bathroom with him and-  I don't read in the bathroom.  Hello?  Uncle Leo?  Nightmares. You?  You're not feeding him, are you?  (Scared) Ah! Kramer!  Get out of here!  Will everybody please leave?!  I want everyone out!  (Bitter) Good night, Newman.  (To Elaine) So, the worst is over?  Seems like you're better at fake relationships than real                ones.  (To cashier) I'd like to speak with the manager, please.  George? What are you doin' here?  (Sarcasticly joking) It certainly has.  (Trying to straighten things out) You defile one book, steal                another, ask for your money back - and to you that's even?  Yes. My Uncle Leo was cought shoplifing here the other day..  (Pleading) Oh, come on. He's just a lonely old man. All                old people steal.  So it could be anyone?  That guy! (Pointing at George) Swarm! Swarm!  New hairdo?  You look like Brenda Starr.  It's better than Dondi.  (Interested, still looking at the couple) Really?  You know, I have a little thing for Beth Lookner.  Yeah.. I've been waitin' out their marriage for three years.  (Noting) You know, I've never seen you drive.  Hi, Beth!  Hey. Hey, Mickey. What's going on?  Really?  Kramer?  Ohh boy. Well, I gotta meet Elaine and run some errands.                So.. (Goes for his coat)  (Fishing for his keys in a kitchen drawer) You know, when                I first met you, Kramer, you used to wear jeans all the time.  (Jokingly playing off Kramer's statement) With a different                body.  Ehh, I dunno..  (His thoughts) I'm so nauseous. She's the worst driver.  (Once again, the audience hears his thoughts) I'm so car                sick. I'm gonna vomit!  (Out of it) Huh?  I don't know, but we don't have much time.  The city's probably teeming with people who've been waiting                out that marriage.  It's like when someone dies in a rent controlled building                - you gotta take immediate action.  Their grieving time is a luxury I can't afford. I'm calling                Beth tonight, and if you want a clean shot at David, I suggest you                do likewise.  But we gotta make it seem like we're not calling for dates.  Good question. (More to himself than to Elaine) Why are                we calling?  (Nodding, trying it out) "I'm there for you."  Hey, remember Beth and David from yesterday? They got separated.  What'd you say?  hey, uh.. (Kramer walks around a little) what'd you get                there?  Slim-fit?  You're walkin' like Frankenstein!  Sure, Beth, these things happen. (Brief pause) So, have                you told many.. people yet?  Anyway, I just called to tell you that, I'm there for you.  Sure, dinner would be fine.  What's wrong?  Alright, alright. Uh, undo them. I'll help you get them                off.  A female orgasm is kinda like the bat cave. A very few people know where it is and if you're lucky enough to see it you probably don't know how you got there and you can't find you way back after you left.  So, what's her name?  Is she nice?  So you like her?  You don't know?  Well do you feel anything?  All right, let me ask you this: when she comes over, you're cleaning up a lot?  You're just straightening up or you're cleaning?  You do the tub?  On your knees, Ajax, scrubbing, the whole deal?  Okay, I think you're in love!  Tub is love. So there you are. You've got a nice girl and a clean apartment.  Sexual?  Below the equator?  Nobody does. You know, nobody knows what to do. You just close your eyes and you hope for the best. I really think they're happy if you just make an effort.   You got the tap?  The tap is tough.  Well maybe she just wanted to move on to other business.  It's a very complicated area.  It's a haaazy mystery.  Really?  And the guy never knows?  How can he not know that?  I guess after that many beers he's probably a little groggy anyway.  What?  Are you saying...  With me?   You faked with me?   You faked with me?  No.  You faked it?  That whole thing, the whole production, it was all an act?  What about the breathing, the panting, the moaning, the screaming?  I'm stunned, I'm shocked! How many times did you do this?  All the time?!  But I'm so good.  She faked.  Maybe they've all been faking.  No no, it was no joke.  No. None.  Faked 'em all.  The woman had an orgasm under false pretences. That's sexual perjury.   How did she do it? She's like Meryl Streep this woman. And I had to work the equipment. I'm not unskilled, I'm in the union. If she'd at least told me, maybe I could have done something about it.   What could you have done?  I'm feeling very inadequate about the whole thing.  Don't aaaaah! I'm supposed to do something with her later? I don't even think I wanna see her.   Hello... Oh hello Elaine.  I don't know, I'm not really in the mood.  What, the grilled cheese? Naaah, they always burn the toast.  Oooh that. Well...  Yeah I guess. So you wanna meet at that place at seven thirty?  All right.  Bye.  I really don't feel like seeing her.  What?!  You faked it? Why would you do that?  Yeah, but why would you...   Bad peach?  Did you get that at Joe's?  That's surprising, his fruit is usually the best.  You're returning used fruit?  Satisfied?  Meryl Streep?  Ah, she's okay.  Yeah. You don't want coffee or anything do you?  Yeah, yeah, can we get off of this?   Nothing.  Nooo.  Give me another shot!  Another shot, I want another shot.  Yes!   Come on! One shot, I can do it, I know I can do it!  Oh friendship... friendship, shmanship .  We won't ruin the friendship.   Elaine...  A half hour, give me a half our.  Okay, fifteen minutes. I guarantee you fifteen minutes, I can make it happen!  You're worried I'll be able to do it aren't you?   That's it, that's it. You like having this over me, you don't want me to do it.  Come on, Elaine!  Elaine?!  Well good night.  Oh that Meryl Streep, she's such a phony baloney.  Oh what, you're upset?  No I can't, maybe you're faking.  I'm sorry too.  You're a baby!  They're mysterious little fellows aren't they?   You know it happens to everybody. It happened to Houdini. And he could get out of a trunk under water with his hands in chains! But he had a problem with that. The miracle is that it ever happens.   Why can't you get it?  What happened?  No. (And to Kramer:) I told you not to say anything.   Well you'll have to go to the supermarket.  Oh so what I'm going to buy all your fruit now?   Hello... Oh hi Patty, thanks for calling me back. I just wanted to ask you a question: when we we're going out did you have orgasms?... Okay, thanks... No that's it... Okay, bye.  Patty Lawrence had 'em!  Yeah.  Hello Elaine? Patty Lorens had orgasms what do you think about that? And I got calls in to six other women and I bet you they confirm an orgasm too. So what do you have to say now Elaine?... Hello?  Why do I feel like I'm doing something wrong?  All this? It's too much. What do you need five mangos for?  Avocado? I don't know how to pick out an avocado.  How soft?  I'm not going through this every week, I tell you that right now. And what are these? Plums? What is that?  Well how do I know what they look like on the inside? What do they look like on the outside?  Plantains?   What the hell is a plantain.  You're not getting any plantains.  Hey Joe.  Good, just getting some fruit for myself. Gotta have fruit in the house. I like it as a snack. Wholesome, natural, chock-full of vitamins. I don't know let's see... mangos... four plums with red on the inside... avocado... ooo, just right... and three plantains ought to do it.  What?  What, what are you talking about?  I can't buy mangos and plantains?  You're making a big mistake, Joe!  You're saying you're banning me from the store?  I'm banned?!  Put it over there.   What are you doing?  You're thinking about it too much. You're putting too much emphasis on it.  Sorry, I don't have any cash.   What?  What is it?  Well well, if it isn't the first lady of the American Theatre. What brings you here?  Oh and I've got some things of yours here.  Well I'll get them.  All right. You got my fins?  I got your poker chips. You got my goggles?  They're next to the poker chips.  I guess.  Yeah, see you.  What?  Are you serious?  Sex... to save the friendship. Well, if we have to...  It's all George's fault. All that talk about impotence. He got to me. And that orgasm stuff: orgasm this and orgasm that. It's a lot of pressure!  I met her on an elevator.  Impossible, right?  I don't know. She was so beautiful, it was like a pure reflex.          The  You know, I'm the one responsible for those crop circles in England.  Can you believe I did that?  Not a good sign.  You got something in your teeth there.  It's green.  Did you bump into anybody you knew?  How'd it go?  What do you need a job, you got Audrey.  What's the matter?  What?  Too late for that.  Yeah, she's got a big nose.  It's a schnoz.  A little.  Stop being so concerned with looks.  Have you said anything to her about it?  Alright, shut up, here they come.  Well, it might not be hell but you're gonna run into some bad          dudes.  We have time.  It is exciting.  Please, please, Isabel? She is the most despicable woman I have          ever  Then what?  She wants to be an actress. She makes me read these moronic acting  So I'm never gonna see her again, I'm going cold turkey.  I'll tell you, the sex... I mean, I was like an animal. I mean          it was  It's not like that at all.  Alright, are we ready? Come on, let's get this show on the road.  Shouldn't a doctor do it?  Great job.  Let's put him over here.  Come on, Kramer, seriously, give me her number!  You're lying! You got it, I want that number!  Give it to me!  Well, I changed my mind, I want that number.  I was lying, give it to me!  I want that number!  I'm Nelson!  Alright, alright, I'm sorry. (reading) Nothing's changed, Alma,          I just  Well, you just need to relax. Maybe a hobby, bowling is fun.  Isabel, uh, I don't think this is working.  So I assume the jig was up.  Hey.  (Sarcastic) Oh, I'm sure she'll come around.  (To George) I said I was sorry.  (Nauseated at the saying) Would you please stop saying that?!  I don't want to talk about it!  'Till she found out Elaine slept with the groom.  I can't believe we went all the way to India for a wedding!  (Pleading) George, I'm sorry..  (Confused) I don't know what that means.  That's got to hurt, I don't care where you're from!  Hey.  Oh, you were pretty loaded.  Oh. Hello, Tetanus.  (As George sits down) George, we need to talk.  Alright, I admit it. I slept with Nina, but that's all.  (Pleading) I'm really sorry.  (Confused) Where'd you get that one?  That doesn't punish me. It punishes Elaine! And cruelly,                I might add.  How did he find out?  You know you're not supposed to drink whil you're keeping                a secret! (Elaine laughs) Is there anything else?  (Handing her a small bottle) Here, drink this.  Pinter?  (Making nothing of it) So? Who cares about that?  Oh, nobody's calling off any weddings. (Elaine, at this                point, has climbed onto the couch and is squirming around - she                now has her backside to Jerry)  (Carrying her out, piggy-back style) No, what?  Yes, jugdish.  (Trying to get rid of her) Yes, I think it's a fine idea.                Well, good night. (Shuts the door)  Bless you.  (Joking around) I think it's the stench of death.  (Giddy) This is gonna be great!  Elaine, have you noticed George was acting strage the whole                flight?  (Pulls a small bottle out of his pocket) Uh-huh. Hey, look                what they had on the plane. Schnapps.  Coach to India - The only way to go.  You all right?  (Joking around) Hey, didn't I beat you up in the fourth                grade?  (Giving Newman a sour look) I'm just hanging out in this                hell-hole because of George.  (Disgusted. To the woman) Oh, come on. You know he's a postman,                don't ya?  (Trying to change the subject away from Nina) Hey, Kramer,                what are you doing? You want to borrow something? You want to eat                something? Come on  (As Kramer is walking in the direction of Newman's apartment)                Hey, Kramer, wait up. I'll go with you.  (Eagerly following Kramer) Great, I love Newman! (They both                leave)  Uh-huh.  Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm..  Uh-huh..  Sure.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  (To Elaine) Uh, well, you know, a coffee grinder is nice.                Or a coffee maker. Everyone likes coffee. Anything to do with coffee.                Maybe you should go get  Sure.  Look, there was an awkward moment in the conversation. It                never happened before.  Nothing. And neither will you. George can never know about                this.. It'll crush him.  No good. Too many people know the combination.  Oh my god. This drawer is filled with Fruit Loops!  And milk.  (From outside the apartment) Hello?  Ah, just remember when you see him tomarrow night to tell                him that the waiter liked him.  Believe me. You know, I forgot how much fun it is hanging                out with you.  I know. No awkward pauses. Probably the reason we never                fooled around..  Probably the reason..  Kramer, I know what I'm talking about. There's no way FDR                wants you to drop dead.  Just go back and ask him again. (Slams the door on Kramer)  (Also guessing) Crook eye?  Well, everybody's a little cranky on their birthday..  (Sarcasticly joking off what George said) Everyday is my                birthday.  (Joking about the bra-less wonder) Well, at least the wedding                gown will give her some support.  So you think it's a non-vite?  Ah, it's probably like Smith over there.  (Picks up the phone, dialing Nina) He wants me to set him                up with this girl, Nina Stengal.  I was kidding when I said that!  (On the phone) Nina, Hi. It's Jerry.  (To Nina) Hey, how 'bout my friend, George? Quite a guy,                huh?  Get outta here.  Hmm..  Sure.  Are you?  We were too compatible.. Our conversations were so engrossing.  If we ever had a problem with Elaine, we could bring in                Nina and not lose a step.  Anyway, like I was saying, I couldn't make the trasition                from conversation to sex. There were no awkward pauses.. I need                an awkward pause.  Why?  So, you're gonna wear 'em no matter what the situation?  Oh, I'm sure it's fine.  Almost. (Notices his shoes) Hey, new Timberlands?  Really?  Nina?  It's been years!  (Introducing the two) George, this is Nina.  (Mesmerized) What are you, a scientist?!  Ah.  Great talkin' to you. (Nina leaves. To himself) What the                hell is e-mail?  Pretty good. I think she might be the one.  What are you bringing snowballs in here for?  Hi, Elaine.  Oh, hi. I-I'm Jerry Seinfeld. I'm movin' in. I saw your                name on the buzzer - You must be Kessler.  Oh.  No, thanks. But I ordered a pizza. You want some of it?  Why not? We're neighbors. What's mine is yours. (And with                that, Jerry made the most fatal mistake of his life)  Come on. Lets go  What's it doin here?  Oh, Bruline. Newman's got the same one.  He's fantastic.  You loaned her Pitt's racquet?  Oh, OK. Next time lets play ping pong. It's easier to jump                over the net.  Bye bye  Hm, really?  Yeah, it was OK. Frankenstein didn't seem quite right to                me.  Not that it was that nice of a jacket. I mean it didn't                fit him   I'm glad you enjoyed it.  It was unbelievable. You're right the jokes kept bouncing                off her  And even when she did like something, she doesn't laugh.                She  I mean how can I be with someone that doesn't laugh. It's                like ...  What noise?  What blah?  Oh, you think she was refunding?  In a manner of speaking.  Thanks.  A matron?  uh, well I can't help you there (weakly).  Kramer you're going to have to face her some time   Why didn't you just ask her for it?  Yeah  C'mon up.  So when do you have to get the racquet back to Mr. Pitt?  He needs a three hundred-dollar Bruline to beat Ethyl Kennedy?  Well, why don't you wait 'til she's not there on her lunch                hour and just  Stealing? You loaned her the racquet!  So what happened with Kramer's mother?  What's she like?  What is it?  We've been trying to get it out of him for ten years. What                is it?  Hi, is Sandy here?  I would except I forgot to bring a towel.  So the roommate laughed at everything I said.  It was a great sounding laugh too, kind of lilting and feminine--none                of  Yeah.  And the worst part of course is that she also possessed                many of the  So as you can see, I've got a bit of a problem here.  Can't be done, huh?  "The Switch."  I wonder.  They didn't have roommates in the Middle Ages.  The point is I intend to undertake this. And I'll do it                with or without  I couldn't do it without you.  Aw, we can't do it, who are we kidding? It's impossible!                It's true! You  Yeah, sure we will.  All right. So I tell Sandy that I want to have a mnage                 trois with her  And you believe this course of action will have a two-pronged                effect.  At this point, it is inevitable that she will seek out the                roommate to  The roommate will then offer her friend the requisite sympathy                even as  Huh. Well, it all sounds pretty good. There's only one flaw                in it:  It's a perfect plan. So inspired. So devious. Yet so simple.  You know, I don't know the exact pronunciation but I believe                its  Uh?  Hey  Ah, that's a shame.  Yeah, I did. In fact I went over there.  No actually, she took it pretty well.  She's into it.  The manage. And not only that. She just called me and said  Oh, it's a scene man.  What are you talking about? I'm not goin' to do it.  I can't. I'm not an orgy guy.   Don't you know what it means to become an orgy guy? It changes                Oh, shut up you couldn't do it either.  Hey, what happened? Did you get your racquet?  What do you mean you got caught?  I still don't understand how you can get in trouble for                taking your own   Hi Cosmo.  Hey, doesn't Newman have a Bruline racquet?  Hum, but you've got the key to his place right?  Well Elaine needs to borrow his racquet. Just for today.                Yeah, that's real interesting. Elaine, listen, tell me if you          think this is funny - <reads comedy he's written> "Men definitely          hit the remote more than women...men don't care what's on TV, men only          care   You don't know? Come on, that's gold!  Oh, that's gold, baby.  I was saying 'baby' way before George!  Well, this guy Leonard Christian's gonna be there tomorrow night.  He's a writer from   Yeah.  Well, you better laugh 'cause I'm being reviewed. Leonard Christian's          gonna be there.  Yeah.  Yeah, you should see George get along with this kid!  Hey, Ronnie. <To bartender> Can I have a club soda? <To          Ronnie> Goin' on tonight?  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  I don't...think so.  I don't...I dunno.  Oh, is this a bit?  Really! You know, a lot of restaurants are serving brewed decaf          now, too.  Oh, you'll have a good time, I swear.  Good, good.  Yeah, why don't you guys get a table so you'll have good seats?  Yeah.  O.k., good, I'll see you later. <Kramer and Toby are about          to exit. She turns around and clutches Kramer's jacket.>  Men definitely hit the remote button more than women...  Yes, yeah...see, men don't care what's on TV, men only care   ...that's why men hunt and women nest.  Hey, what's the deal? What was goin' on there? I invite you down          here, I have an important show, and she heckles me?!  Well, what is the matter with her? Is she crazy?!  Hey! What is wrong with you?!  You boo me?! You hiss?! You didn't stop blathering throughout          the whole set!  No! Not part of the show! Booing and hissing are not part of the          show! You boo puppets! You hiss villains in silent movies!  Oh, I can take it.  Did you knock her over too, or just the kids?  Really? Her mother.  You probably couldn't see because of the smoke.  So you feel "women and children first," in this day          and age, is somewhat of an antiquated notion.  So basically, it's every man, woman, child, and invalid for themselves.  Well, it's honest.  Well, perhaps when she's released from the burn center, she'll          see things differently.  So, what was the fire? Just a couple of greasy hamburgers?  By the way, did you see this? <Hands George a magazine>  It's the Leonard Christian article about my show. Plus my gig          in Miami got cancelled, I betcha it's because of the article.  I should have let her have it! I held back because of Kramer.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, that'd be something.  But wouldn't that be the ultimate comedian's revenge? I've always          had a fantasy about doing that.  Why can't I?  You know what? I think I'm gonna do that! She came down to where          I work, I'll go down to where she works!  There's no precedent, baby!  Hey, nice shoes. What, you wear sandals to work? It's always nice          to walk into a room and get the aroma of feet. That's real conducive to          the work atmosphere. I'm sure your co-workers really appreciate it. 'Hey,          let's go eat in Toby's office. Great idea! We can check on her bunions!'  Oh, is this disruptive? You find it hard to work with someone...interrupting?  Security? Well, I don't know how you're gonna make it in this          business if you can't take it! Ya gotta be tough! Booo! Boooo!  Because she came down to the club and heckled me! Give her a taste          of her own medicine! <George enters.>  Well, I didn't want her to have an accident.  You kept makin' all the stops?    Why?  Too bad.  Because Elaine, that's the one that goes 'wee-wee-wee all the          home.'  So, I went down to the magazine, I pleaded with him to come and          see me again, finally he agreed to come down tonight, and he's going to          write another article.  Damn right! We've been lapdogs long enough!  Well, it's about time one of us drew a line in the sand.  Yeah, well, won't be long.  Gotta go. <heads out on stage>  I mean, Bozo the Clown...does he really need "the clown"          in his title, as clown? Bozo, "the" clown? Are we going to confuse          him with Bozo the district attorney? Bozo the pope? There's no other Bozo...  ...that's why men hunt and women nest.  George - could I have a word?  I'm sorry it's gotta be a little bit of a scary place to                work. I don't know how you feel about it. You want to be standing                there having people comming in all day going "I need knives.                I need more knives. Do you have any bigger knives? I'd like a bigger                knife, a big, long, sharp knife, that's what I'm in the market for.                I like them really sharp. Do you have one with hooks and gouges                like blades and kind of serrated? That's the kind of knife I'm looking                for. I need one I can throw. I need another one I can just hack                away with. Do you have anything like that?   Oh yeah, like you know what you're talking about.  Well what do you think? They put the statue on a giant raft                and a tugboat pulled it all the way from France?  I don't know. It's too early for a Christmas party isn't                it?  It was a gift.  If they like each other.   See that guy he's talking with? That's her new boyfriend.  Yeah. They're having a little fling so don't say anything.                You don't. He's a recovering alcoholic.  Yeah. He's been off the wagon for two years.  I think it's off the wagon.  What am I doing here? Ba-boom (holding out a present)  Hey keep your hands to yourself if you know what's good                for you.  Under the sofa cushion.  It's your Christmas present.  "The guy?"  Cranberry juice?  So... I'm Jerry. (he puts down the drink)  Why don't get we together New Years day and watch some football.                There. (turns to George) So, how did it go?  Oh, uh, I think maybe Dick picked up yours.  I didn't know you meant *hold* it, I thought you meant hold                it.  I never feel comfortable in the women's department. I feel                like I'm just a *little* too close to trying on a dress.  Hey the woman got you a job. The least you could do is buy                her a gift. How about this?  Yeah. She would love cashmere.  Look at this. It's 85 dollars marked down from 600.  Oh it's damaged. (grabbing the sweater)  It's hard to say.   Well I can see it.  Well what do you want me to do? Not look at it?  It's hard to pretend because I know where it is.  You want me to take an overview?  I see a very cheap man holding a sweater trying to get away                with something. That's my overview.  Yeah so?  Oh boy, can you smell it?  Well if you can't smell it then he hasn't been drinking.  Yes you do.  Yes you would.  I'll prove it. Would you do me a favor?   Would you take a drink and let us smell you?  I got a bottle of scotch my uncle gave me. It's Hennigans.                It's been here for two years. I've been using it as a paint thinner.  I don't smell anything.  Yeah.  Come on up.  Kramer. Yeah that'll do.  I tried to stop him. I couldn't. He just wants to make people                happy.  (uncomfortable) Uh, I don't know. Uh, I don't know.  I don't know.  Ahem. Say that again?  Do I see it... or don't I? That's the question.  Now what did you ask me again.  You had sex with the cleaning woman on your desk? Who are                you, how did you do that?  Yeah chambermaids, I'm attracted to them too.  It's a woman in your room. So go ahead.  Convulsing?  I don't know, I'm trying to help you.  You don't drink.  So you started drinking.  So how was it?  Good thing the cleaning lady was there.  You mean to tell me if I had put that drink six inches over                to the right, and none of this would have happened.  What are you saying?  You're saying something.  Well you're not saying nothing you must be saying something.  Well why don't you say it?  What did you say?  Yeah?  Come on up.  No I didn't.  I didn't have an expression. I have a deviated septum. I                have to open my mouth sometimes to breathe.  Frankly I am shocked that you would ask such a question                (Elaine sticking out her tongue like she isn't buying a word of                it) of me, that you would think - the only surprise is how you could                even think of that. That's what you were seeing.  Elaine is in the bathroom. She's wise to whole red dot thing.                She's asking me all kinds of questions.  No.  I'm not swearing. I don't want to swear.  No.  I didn't tell her you stupid idiot. She tricked you.  I was in the men's room the other day and they had the hand                blower, instead of the paper towels, you know this thing. I like                the hand blower I have to say. It takes a little bit longer, but                I feel when you're in a room with a revolting stench you want to                spend as much time as you can.  Oh, wait a second, I believe we have a heckler ladies and                gentlemen. Hey Dick I don't know what your problem is. It's not                my fault you're back on the wagon.  In the old days how do you think they got the alcohol from                town to town?  On the wagon. Don't you think they broke into a couple of                those bottles along the way?  They had smooth trails. What about the Cumberland Gap?  I know enough not to get on them.  George?  George?  I'm taking the kid out to dinner to chear him up.  I would say when the nipple makes its first appearance.  Nice try. So guess who heckled me at the club last night.  Get off of me.  But in a way, I think I inadvertantly turned this guy into                an alcoholic. I hate being around alcoholics because they're either                telling you how much they love you or how much they hate you. And                those are the two statements that scare me the most. But I think                he's okay now because I have no idea how he feels about me. He's                finally off the wagon.  Don't get smart.                                                                                                     It seems like whenever these office people call you in for a meeting,          the whole thing is about the sitting down. I would really like to sit          down with you. I think we need to sit down and talk. Why don't you come          in, and we'll sit down. Well, sometimes the sitting down doesn't work.          People get mad at the sitting.You know, we've been sitting here for I          don't know how long. How much longer are we just going to sit here? I'll          tell you what I think we should do. I think we should all sleep on it.          Maybe we're not getting down low enough. Maybe if we all lie down, then          our brains will work.  I know what you mean.  It's like going out with someone and you never hear from them again.  Not really, but it's something. Ask the people behind you.  So what are you doing later? You want to go to the movies?  To see a movie.  Not this movie.  Did you shower today?  That's usually the kind of mood I'm in when I haven't showered.  Oh, quit complaining. At least you have your health.  What is that?  Ey, ey!  Nothing.  Have a good time.  You know you're turning into Burt Lancaster?  Jill's father is in the hospital and you call to ask about him on a cell phone?  Faux pas.  You can't make a health inquiry on a cell phone. It's like saying "I don't         want to take up any of my   It's an act of total disregard. It's selfish.  It's pompous.  Hey - hey - hey!  Where do you think this relationship is? If you are thinking of instituting an         open-door urination policy, let me disabuse you of that notion right now, my friend.  Uptight? Let's all just have a big pee party. Hey everybody, grab a bucket.         We're going up to Jerry's. It's a pee party.  Hello. Yeah, hi, this is Jerry Seinfeld calling for James Kimbrough. Hello? Hi?         Uh huh, really, uh, no problem,  He is the new president of NBC. He wants to sit down with us and talk about         "Jerry."  Right.  Yeah!  Today, like right now.  "Jerry"!  He wants to talk about "Jerry"!  "Jerry"!  Sure!  Forget the sports jacket.  You're not a writer.  Ok, now listen, I don't want any scenes in here like the last time.  Don't blow this.  If he says he doesn't want it to be a show about nothing, don't go nuts.  He might not want nothing.  He might want a show about anything and everything.  All right.  What?  Good, good. You remember George.  Don't spell.  Shut up, George.  Oy.  Because the next day in the offices, people gather around the water coolers to         talk about it, right?  Well it's probably just easier to say "water cooler show" than         "coffee machine show."  But I think Mr. Kimbrough makes a good point.  He's a little off the wall.  Definitely.  Yeah!  Hi. Elaine, it's me.  No no - this is an emergency - get off the phone.  The "Jerry"'s back on - the TV show! George and I are moving to   Did you hear what I said?  Jill? Well, why didn't you say so?  So now she's lost a phone face-off? That's even worse than your cell phone         walk-and-talk.  Yeah, it's pretty good.  NBC is letting me use their private jet? And I can go anywhere I want? That's         fantastic! Thanks. Great.   Hey - how was the beach?  I had a little meeting today at NBC. What are you doing?  So do you remember five years ago, we did that pilot, "Jerry"? Well,         the new guy at NBC wants to do it.   Yeah, only for a while.  No, I'll be back.  And my agent said as a bonus, I can use their private jet, so we'll all go         somewhere - the four of us, one big fling before George and I go to California.  Anywhere.  I think they want to make it up to us cause they let this thing sit on their         shelf for five years.  Russia, it's so bleak.  It's still bleak.  You can be bleak in spring.  Alright - come on - come on now, people. Let's face it, we're not all going to         agree on anything.   So that's it - it's settled, we're going to Paris.  Wait, you can't make a call like that on your way out. You can't rush that         conversation.  First you make a cell-phone walk-and-talk, then she loses a call-waiting         face-off, now you're talking about  Hello, Newman. What gives?  Yeah, that's right.  Really.  That's a shame.  Oh, forget it. Pull yourself together. You're making me sick. Be a man!  Yeah.  All set. We'll just grab the bags.  Just keeps on getting better and better.  Not bad.  You're complaining about a private jet?  Ted Danson is not even on the network anymore.  You're not writing any letters!  Still got water in your ear?  Kramer, what the hell did you do?  Kramer!  Is this it? Is this how it ends? It can't- it can't end like this.  Yeah.  What? What is it?  What?  Why?  Great - I won.  Yeah, Elaine I got something I want to say to you.  Alright.  We're straightening out!  Where are we?  Okay.  We'll see you later.  I say we go back to New York, and take a regular flight.  Alright, I'll feel him out.  Another one?  Well, there goes the money for the lipo.  That's a shame. Alright, I'm gonna call NBC.  Okay, thanks anyway. They can't get another plane.  No, no, no. We're not getting on there. Come on, let's go get something to eat         in Sticksville.  Under arrest? What for?  Oh, yeah.  But then we would have missed the whole thing.  I forgot about the video.  Plane's ready.  You know I've had to reduce my milk level. My whole life I've always filled to         at least three quarters - sometimes, to the top of the cereal. Now, to conserve, I can't         even see the milk anymore. It's a big adjustment.  It's one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.  Good morning.  No.  This one?  Do I have to?  Yeah.  Well, there goes the money for the lipo.  Gimme that rye.  I want that rye lady.  Shut up, you old bag!  The virgin!  Who the hell is that?  That's right, the Bubble Boy.  He's a boy who lives in a bubble.  Why would I do it unless I was in mortal danger? I know it's against the law.  Because I could get uromycitisis poisoning and die - that's why.  Who?  Medium crab bisque.  Just forget it. Let it go.  How did they find Babu?  Do they make you wear uniforms in prison?  It's not that bright orange one is it?  Hey Elaine, what was it you were about to say to me on the plane when it was         going down?  Maybe because she knows you're going to jail.  What?  Well, it's only a year. That's not so bad. We'll be out in a year, and then         we'll be back  Sure.  I think that would be a very nice gesture.  See now, to me, that button is in the worst possible spot.  Oh yeah. The second button is the key button. It literally makes or breaks the         shirt. Look at it, it's   You think?  Yeah, maybe we have.  So what is the deal with the yard? I mean when I was a kid my mother wanted me         to play in the yard. But of   I'll talk slower. I'm kidding - I love Cellblock D. My friend George is in         Cellblock D. What are you in for,sir?  Murder one? Oooooo, watch out everybody. Better be nice to you. I'm only kidding         sir - lighten up. How about   Grand theft auto - don't steal any of my jokes.  Hey, I don't come down to where you work, and knock the license plate out of         your hand.  Alright, hey, you've been great! See you in the cafeteria.  George.  Sorry, the flight was delayed, how long've you been waiting?  So you have no car?  So what good are you?  I'll tell you one thing, this chauffeur's gonna be waiting a while,  He was in Chicago, the flight was overbooked, wouldn't let him          on the  Yeah, right.  He's definitely in Chicago.  Are you sure you can't stay longer?   He was 96 years old.   Well, what ever you do, you're wearing me out.   Really?   Are you sure you don't need a hand with that?   Did you give blood?   In case of what?   Are we finished?   Who wants to responsible? When ever anything goes wrong, the first          thing they ask is: who's responsible for this?   What happened, I thought you were with Tara tonight?   What?   Hey, you guys think I'm getting a little...chunky?   Elaine, what do you think?   Didn't go for it, huh?   So, she didn't appreciate the erotic qualities of the salted cured          meats?   Natural? Sex is about love between a man and a woman, not a man          and a sandwich.   Maybe instead of trying to satisfy two of your needs, how about          satisfying one of somebody else's.   I told you George, no more pudding. I'm starting a purification          program. Keep all that kind of food away from me.   What the hell is that?   Oh, why?   What, it...it's here in the building?   No I don't! In fact, if even one corpuscles of that blood should          find it's way across that hall I will freak out on you Kramer! Freak out.          You know it and I ditched all my junk food.   Sorry buddy, clean house. It's all health food.   Is this about me?   Oh, then I lost interest.   Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you were baby-sitting          at Vivian's.   Oh no, where's the blood? [opens the fridge] It's in here isn't          it?   What is this?   What about this? This is blood isn't it?!   Ooh, you're sick! You're sick!!   Hey, what's going on? Who made pudding?   Damn that George, I told him I don't want this stuff around here          anymore...   Aaah...   Aah!   I can see that! What happened?   I'll remember that.   What?   I can feel his blood inside of me. Borrowing things from my blood.          So, how's the fornicating gourmet?   George, we're trying to have a civilization here.   Hey, how was baby-sitting?   Oh, I'm sure it won't be the worst.   Really?   I'm not touching that thing.   Oh, no...   Kramer, I'm not shaving your neck.   All right, all right I'll do it, sit down.   Hello?   Kramer called you?   Yes, I'm fine.   I don't need a personal trainer. [Kramer comes in] all right I've          got to go, we'll talk about this later.   Why are you calling my parents?   Why here?   Ok...   Fine...   No no no no no no no no no no! I do not want that in here!   All right.   Mr. Mandelbaum? You're the personal trainer?   Ok Mr. Mandelbaum, what you want me to do?   Is this a gym, or some kind of fitness museum?   For what?   How many session did my parents paid for?   What is this?   I thought you were gonna watch a video.   Kramer, I'm not in a mood for this.   Blood over there, sausages over here. I'm living in a slaughter          house.   No they're not mine Mr. Mandelbaum...   So, the free love buffet is over?   Yeah, that's what you did...I can't believe I got another session          with Izzy Mandelbaum, he's probably makes me box a kangaroo.   What's going on?   Oh no, I'll tell you what you did Caligula; you combined food          and sex in to one disgusting uncontrollable urge.   No, but please tell me that's all you're gonna do with it.   All right, that's enough of that. [Jerry takes the plates and          hands them to a waitress.]   Well, sleepy here is quite a weasel, maybe he can bat for you.          It wasn't me, it was Mr. Mandelbaum.   What's wrong with yours?   All right, but this is it, this is the last favor, we're even!          Is this really necessary?   What if I can't keep up?   What's going on?   Oh my God, the blood!   Well, for the first quarter mile they thought that I was just          doggin' it.   What's the kid doing here?   Oh, that's a drag...   You put blood in the car?!   Well, they told me that I got more blood, so I guess I owe you          again.   Then who?   Aaaaahhh...!!!   Remember, don't whistle on the elevator.  That's what Willie Loman told Biff before his interview,                in 'Death of  What time is the lesbian wedding?  I'm so tired.

Hey Elaine if a guy wanted to end a relationship with you                . What could he do?  Does she hate cigarettes?  But you don't smoke.  You know, I think I'm getting a little depressed about George's                wedding.  Yeah. Well once he gets married that's it, she'll probably                get pregnant, they'll move to Westchester.  Then it'll just be me, you and Kramer.  So it's just gonna be me and Kramer.  See you ... me and Kramer...  (annoyed) How you gonna drive when looking through a periscope?                Besides it's not a submarine  They're not making higher roofs.

She talks like me, she acts like me.  Now I know what I've been looking for all these years......myself!                (Kramer is speechless)  (shrugs) Hey George I think I want to bring a date to the                wedding  I just met her, she's incredible.

Something on your mind?  Looks like there is?  Come on. Something's on your mind. Out with it.  You don't like her?  What's wrong with her?  Well you can't take her maybe you can't take me either.

Well it's been quite a night I could sure use a cup of coffee.  (weakly) I dunno  (to waitress) I' ll just have a cup of coffee.  More cereals? that's your third bowl today, you had it for                breakfast and lunch.  Thanks , thanks   Yeah , yeah .  I think I may have made a big mistake.  All of a sudden it hit me, I realized what the problem is;                I can't be with someone like me..  Yeah! Too bad.  Hello. Oh! Hi George.......What! ..really! All right I'll                call Elaine , we'll meet you down there.  They just took Susan to the Hospital  So she was just lying there.  Dead?  Yeah! me too  How did it happen?  So I guess , you're not getting married?  But....  Well , now I'm engaged..  Well I thought we'd both be getting married.  WE HAD A PACT!!!  Good morning.  Hey, you are the couch tonight, young lady. You were all over          my side.  C'mon, I was sleeping with one cheek off the bed!  No, no, 12-8!  I know I can't beat ya, I'm just trying to stay competitive.  Uh, let me get a coat. I think I'll try a sport jacket and scarf          thing, you know, like an unemployed actor. <Goes into his room, and          comes back out with the jacket on.> Haven't worn this one in a long          time.  No, gore-tex. It's new. <Checks his pockets.> Hey, look          at this locket. What the hell is this? There's a picture in here, look          at that.  No, I haven't worn this jacket since I got it back from the dry-cleaner.          Maybe we should ask him.   Yeah. What do you want to get for breakfast?  Oh now, c'mon, you know I'm getting pancakes.  But we can't both get pancakes, it's embarrassing. It's like one          step from the couples who dress alike.  Ah, that's why I love ya. 15-9. <They go out into the hallway          and run into Kramer and his African-American girlfriend, Anna.> Hey,          how ya doin.'  Hey, is that my maple syrup? <Kramer hands it over.>  Boy, it's a lucky thing I put the jacket on. But how did it get          in the pocket?   Oh, wow.  Oh, come on!  It's silly!  Get outta here!  Oh...yeah...you've never met my wife, Meryl? Meryl Seinfeld.  You might regret that, because the money my wife spends on clothes...  Ah - see the sense of humor? C'mere, I'm so nuts about you...<hugs          Meryl.> I tell ya, it was fun being single, but when you meet a woman          like this, you don't walk to get married - you run!   Pardon?  Um, yeah...I think my wife and I'll have a little more coffee.  Adoring? What about handsome?   Sure, adoring's good for you, what does it do for me? <Meryl          laughs. The owner of the coffee shop comes over.>  I, uh...well...  Well, I told my wife not to bring it.  No, just Meryl.  Because she's my wife! <The door buzzer sounds, and Jerry lets          Elaine into the building - Jerry: Yeh? Elaine: Meh. Jerry: Eh.> And          I'll tell ya, I'm really enjoying this marriage thing. You think about          each other. You care about each other. It's wonderful! Plus, I love saying          "my wife." Once I started saying it, I couldn't stop - "my          wife" this, "my wife" that...it's an amazing way to begin          a sentence.  See?  Oh come on, we're gonna start doing this now? I can't be taking          all your dry-cleaning in!  Alright. <Elaine enters.>  The fly-boy.  Hey, where's George? I thought he was with you.  So?  Really.  Moisture?  That's an open-lip kiss, alright.  I don't know why you're interested in this guy, he's a jerk.  Yeah, so?  Here we go.  No, never.  Do the medical journals mention anything about standing in a pool          of someone else's urine?  Hello.  What are you doing here?  Oh. <Smiles at Marty nervously.> Well, I must have been          in the incinerator room when you left. Here you go, Marty. <Hands over          Kramer's quilt.>  Uncle Leo!  Hello.  Uh...I got married.  Well, it was sudden.  No, no, it was a small ceremony.  Yes, yes, you have.  You did, you did.  I'm a good printer.  Well, it's not here, it was here yesterday.  I'm looking in the first drawer. It's not here.  Listen, Ma...  Mom, I'm not married.  I'm not married!  I'm just pretending I'm married to get a discount on dry-cleaning.          Well, whoopie whoop. <Meryl goes into the other room. Kramer          staggers in the door in his bathrobe.>  Yeah. <Kramer lurches into the kitchen, trips, and falls onto          the kitchen floor.> I'll get it, I'll get it! Take it easy, why are          you so tired?  What is that? <Points to Kramer's pocket as Meryl comes back.>  Hey, I'm sorry about all that can opener stuff.  Love you.  Goodnight. <They kiss goodnight, then promptly roll away from          each other and go to sleep.>  Bottle-wipe supercedes it.  Alright, can we just drop all the pee-pipe stuff here?  Alright.  Alright, I'll pick it up, but it's the last time I'm doin' it!  Hello? Oh, hi honey. <annoyed, weary> Yes, I told him. I'll          get it. <George and Elaine give each other a look, then leave Jerry          to argue with Meryl on the phone.> Whenever. Okay, I'm sorry...  He's a very good friend of mine, he's kind've like an older brother          to me...when things don't go right, he kinda takes it personally.  Oh, it's okay, it'll be okay.  Where you goin'?  I can't believe you still do that. You know those things are bad          for ya.  I'm goin' home. <Kramer exits. An attractive woman enters the          dry-cleaners with a bundle of clothes in her hands. Jerry notices her          and waits by the door.>  I want to!  Give me the clothes.   Oh, the hell with her. <Paula dramatically flees from the coffee          shop. Jerry thinks for a second, then follows her and catches up to her          on the street.>  I'm not gonna let you walk out of my life.  Do you want box or hanger?  I'm sorry.  It doesn't matter. I want a divorce.  Yes, that's right.  I'll tell you what happened. We got married.  No. I guess I just wasn't ready for the responsibilities of a          pretend marriage.  It's alright, I want you to have it.  We'll always have...pancakes.  I don't know about you, but I'm getting sick of pretending                to be excited  Unbelievable! She's not there.  The works for the NYU school newspaper. She's a grad student                in   Y'know, you've been developing quite the acid-tongue lately...  Living or all time?  Well, if it's all time, then there's no contest. It begins                and ends   [indignantly] What's the matter with you?  I'm not goin' along. I can just see you in Berlin in 1939                goose-  Y'know I hear that all the time.  That I'm gay. People think I'm gay.  Yeah, 'cuz I'm single, I'm thin and I'm neat.  Oh yeah, what? "Buck Naked"?  You told me that already like two months ago.  How you gonna get out of *that* one?  He's gonna hang around if that's alright with you?  Yeah, I washed it.  So *wash* *it*.  I didn't say I didn't like it. I said it was O.K...  Oh, so what if I don't like it. Is that like the end of                the world, or  Actually, we met in the gym locker room.  [quizzically] Live together?  Know *what*?  Oh God, you're that girl in the coffee shop that was eavesdropping                on  There's been a big misunderstanding here! We did that whole                thing   I mean that's fine if that's who you are...  I mean I have many gay friends...  It was a *joke*...  No steam!  Today's not my birthday.  Look at this! A phone! A two-line phone!  Hey, where you going?  Thank you very much, that's great- >click< Oh! Hold                on a sec, I got  Hey, how ya doin'? Y'know I got that reporter from the newspaper                on  She says she's not going to play up that angle of the story.                She   What are you talkin' about?  You heard me talkin' on the other line, are you sure?  Well, maybe she was disconnected.  Alright, hang on. Let me call Kramer and see if you can                hear anything,  Kramer, there may be a problem with the phone, hold on.                >click click<  Oh no! >click click< Kramer, this phone's a piece                of junk, goodbye!  Oh no! Now she's heard everything! What are we gonna do?!?  No, no, of course not! People's personal sexual preferences                are   She wouldn't take her coat off at my house, either.  So you don't take your coat off, and now everyone at NYU                thinks I'm gay.  "Guys And Dolls"? Isn't that a lavish, Broadway                musical?  "The Collected Works Of Bette Midler".  What do you got there?  "Although they maintain separate residences, the comedian                and his  Not that there's anything wrong with that...  "Within the confines of his fastidious bachelor *pad*,                Seinfeld and  Here we go...  It's not true!  So are you...  Oh, my God! [takes the phone] Ma?  Ma!  Ma, it's not true!  Ma, it has nothing to do with the culottes!  Y'know, I think I'll pass on the "Guys And Dolls"...  What?  I dunno... [they kiss again] *Alright*, I forgive you...  I was attracted to you, too. You remind me of Lois Lane.  What!?  I know! What are you doin' here?!?  [forcibly removing G. from the apt] Would you get the Hell                out of   Tell her what?  I am not gay. I am, however, thin, single and neat. Sometimes                when   You know their timing couldn't be worse.  You don't understand, I haven't been together with Rachel for          like three weeks. First I was on the road, then my parents show up, I'm          getting a little uh backed up.   Not for another three days.  She lives with her parents.  (sarcastically)Ya, then maybe baldness will catch on. This will          all be turning your way.   The baldies  That's good, then I get the apartment for at least one night.          You know I'm paying for this whole Paris trip it's their anniversary present.  Hey Alec  What happened?  (acting like Joey) Wouldn't you like to pass the ketchup to someone          like me? Please?  Hey did you notice they moved where they do the interview on Jeopardy          now?  Ya, it's much better isn't it?  Hey, I gotta stop off at the bookstore to pick up my parents one          of those French-English dictionaries.  What?  Yea?  What about little Joey?  Ah, I think he's probably better off.  He wants this guy to think he's in Paris.   Because George is a deeply disturbed individual.  Ya, or if you're ever on Fifth Avenue here in New York City, you          could get some there.  (watching the whole conversation from his desk) What plans?   Where'd you get plans?  (walking over toward George and the door) I'll call you later.  So what plans do you have?  So how come you're not going over there for dinner?  Really? Since when?  Why?  No I notice but they're from your age group I didn't know you          could detect abnormal behavior among your own kind.   Ya?  U-oh come on up. (buzzes them up) It's Elaine you don't have a          problem with her do you?  She wants to say hi, she's with her new boyfriend.  He's nice, bit of a close talker.  You'll see. (pause) Boy, I had no idea you felt this way about          the Costanzas'  No I haven't.  I'm swamped.  Maybe I'll try and catch up with you.  Ok buh bye. Have a good time.  Ok.  I don't know.  Maybe he was just trying to be nice.  Wait a second, he just did me a big favor.  (dialing) He got em out of the house.  Call Rachel.  (on the phone) ah no, I got the machine. Rachel! Are you there?!          I got the place to myself for a few hours! Rachel! Where are you? Rachel!          (hangs up the phone very disappointed)   (disappointed) Oh, Hi, hi.  Oh sure like Monet.  Well he's from the impressionist school, you know like Monet,          Manet, Tippi Tippi Dayday.  (answering phone) Hello? Rachel, ya uh no they're back.  Uh haha ya well uh I'm sorry too I'll call you later, ok bye (hangs          phone up)  Bye  The belt-less trench coat. My father invented it.  This is like the meeting of Smith and Wesson.  N-na I'm paying for the trip.  He also came up with an idea for a brimless rain-hat but that          never materialized. (to Morty) Alright come on let's play.  Ah come on.  No I haven't seen it yet.  I'm going  Ok  I hate clothes, okay? I hate buying them. I hate picking                them out of my closet. I can't stand every day trying to come up                with little outfits for myself. I think  I think I've seen enough.  Why don't they open up an entire store for the back? Call                it, "Just Back." All back. No front. You walk in the front,                you're immediately in the back. (Picks  (Pointing to Elaine) Her father wrote that.  ..I guess I'm coming.. I mean..  No, I'll go. I'm going.  I'm worried I won't be able to talk to him. He's such a                great writer. Frankly, I perfer the company of nitwits.  (Looks at a jacket) What is this? (Holds it up) This is                beautiful.. but these jackets never fit me right.  This may be the most perfect jacket I have ever put on.                (Elaine grabs the tag) How much is it?  Bad? (Elaine nods) ..Very bad?  I have some idea.  I've got a ballpark.  (Looks at the tag) ..That is high.  (Looking at the insides of the jacket) What's with the pink                lining and the candy stripes?  Should I get it? I hate these moments. I'm hearing the dual                voices now, you know. "What about the money?" "What's                money?"  Hey.  What do you think?  Is it me?  Really?  I don't know. It's got a pink lining.  I paid what it costs.  What's the difference?  I'd rather not say it out loud. It's embarrassing.  Yes, but let's just stop it right there.  Really, I'm not answering anymore.  Would you?  I know, I know.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Do you want it?  (Takes one last look at the leather jacket) ..Okay, take                it.  What is that song?  You know, Schumann went mad from that.  No, you idiot.  You don't know Rober Schumann? The composer?  (Trying to scare George) He went crazy from one note. He                couldn't get it out of his head. I think it was an A. He kept repeating                it over and over again. He  I know exactly what's goin to happen tonight. I'm gonna                try and act like I'm not impressed, he's gonna see right through                it.  Let me just get my jacket. (Moves to the bedroom)  Wednesday. This jacket has completely changed my life. When                I leave the house in this, it's with a whole different confidence.                Like tonight, I might've been  Absolutely.  I know.  Well, what kind of solid?  Birds?  So take a cab.  I can't. I'm on my way out. There's no way I can do it.  (Scoffs) Two minutes. Believe me, I know his two minutes..                By his conception of time, his life will last over two thousand                years.  (Points to his head) Schumann. (George gets visibly scared)                Where are they?  What, you don't want to do this?  Yeah, I think it is. (They walk tward him) Where's Elaine?  Excuse me.. Mister Benes?  I'm Jerry. Elaine's friend.. and this is George.  Sure.  (To waiter) I'll have a cranberry juice with two limes.  Well, we thought she was meeting you earlier. She's usually                pretty punctual. (Alton remains quiet) ..Don't you find that, George?  Yeah, yeah. Sometimes she's on time, and sometimes she's                late.  It appears that way.  Yep.  I'm just a regular person.  Would you excuse me a minute? I'm gonna go to the bathroom.                I'll be right back.  That was brutal. I can't go back out there.  Elaine'll kill me.  She's gotta be here soon.  The waiter was trembling.  How are we gonna get out of it?  Yeah, that's good. He'd clunk our heads together like Moe.  All fathers are intimidating. They're intimidating because                they are fathers. Once a man has children, for the rest of his life,                his attitude is, "To hell with the  (Adding) Well, Guatamala.  What about Elaine?  She'll be furious.  That's her! She's here!  Where have you been?!  Oh, you didn't..  (After hearing Elaine's story, his is..) Great.  Oh, no, no.  I can't believe it. You know better than to get involved                with Kramer.  Ah, the lift. Like the lure of the siren's song. Never what                it seems to be, yet who among us can resist?  (To George) Snow.. snow, that can't be good for suede, can                it?  What should I do? (To Alton) We're taking a cab, aren't                we?  Inside out! Great.  Oh, I turned my jacket inside out.  (Like a child) Well, it's a new suede jacket. It might get                ruined.  (Into intercom) Elaine?  Come on up.  Hey.  So?..  I can't believe I do.  Yeah.  I was out in the snow last night.  I have an idea. (Elaine enters) We can make the nine-thirty                at Cinema III.  Is he still in town?  I don't know.  Really?  Well, I can't wear it.  Yeah, go ahead, take it.  Oh, because of all that singing?  I'll try and remember that.  (Sarcastic) Yeah, too bad.  I had a leather jacket that got ruined. Now, why does moisture                ruin leather? I don't get this. Aren't cows ouside most of the time?                I don't understand it.  I love it when people are complimented on something they're   Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.  (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.  (tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?  Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.  You know, the only way to really help her is to just let her be.  You're really going to town with that turkey there.  It's on the door.  Hey, hey. Wha... wait... what, you're gonna leave it there?   (sarcasm) Yeah, you're right. I really should keep more of your  What arrangement?  (sarcasm) Yeah, well, lemme know when you get something in there          Hey. What's with your neck?  Well, if it's any consolation, I did get her number.  Aw, I doubt you strained it. Maybe you pulled it.  Did you twist it? You coulda twisted it.  Did you wrench it? Did you jam it? Maybe you squeezed it. Turned          Awright.  What's even more amazing is his formal training is in   I dunno. (realising) Oh, 'cos you said you'd give the bike to          Oh yeah.  Well, that's the most he's worked in the last four months.  Seven? Yeah, I guess I could see it. Seven. Seven periods of   Awright, let's see. How about Mug? (picks up the mug) Mug   I got fifty right here in the cupboard. How about Bisquik?   Oh, I forgot to call Christie.  Yeah, she had this great black and white dress, with a scoop   (smug) I'm not engaged.  Got what?  Oh, it's no problem. You can take whatever you want.  Sort of a mooching inventory.  Alright.  Kramer, I don't know if you're getting that bike.  Well this is it. The food is atrocious, but the busboys are the          The exact same outfit.  Three.  Possibly, but then shouldn't the outfit only reappear again at          Why? It's our first date, she's already in reruns?  Indeed.  Well, if she splits the atom, I'll let it slide.  Hey, did Susan change her mind about the name?  You know, George, just because your life is destroyed, don't   How about 'Mickey'?  (holding up a can) Hey, is this your half a can of soda in the          What?  You cannot buy half a can of soda.  Well, I don't wanna get into the whole physics of carbonation          That is the sound of you buying a whole can. And the same goes          ...When you pierce the skin of a piece of fruit, you've bought          ...You bite it, you bought it.  Thank you.  Hey  Haven't seen him. How's the neck?  Boy, I'm surprised. (sarcasm) I would think Kramer would have          a   You saw her? What was she wearing?  Didn't you get a glimpse? An impression?  Both times I've seen her she's worn the same dress.  Well, I'm flattered that you would both appeal to my wisdom, but  Course, it would have to be someone who hasn't heard the story          No, I'm just a little uh, worn out.  Oh, I'm sure you do.  Oh.  Change? (thoughtful) Yes, I think that's a super idea.  (looking around) Ah, so this is the Fortress of Solitude.  Yes, change. By all means, change.  What're you doing? I thought you were changing.  No, no. C'mon, put something else on. It's early, let's go out.  You know, I'm kinda tired myself. Maybe I'll just sleep here on          You wanna throw something on and walk me to a cab?  (pleading) Tell me what you're wearing tomorrow. I'll help you          Hello, Christie? I was wondering if we could get together again?  Alright, hobo Joe. I didn't wanna put a damper on your little          I know. Pretty steep.  Few do.  Yeah, well, until this bill is paid...  ...the food court is closed.  I love it when people are complimented on something they're   Boy, I miss the days they made toys that could kill a kid.  (admiring Christie) Yeah, I'm right there with ya.  (tearing himself away from Christie) Huh?  Oh yeah, be great for your paper route.
