That took awhile.  I'd like to help, but my neck..  So how long has it been in the basement?  What's in it?  I know someone who'll do it. She's good. She's honest.  Students can't clean. It's anathema. (Jerry's confused) ..They          don't like it.  Wait a second. I can't believe this! Let me see this.  Let me just see it.  Let me just see it for a second. Oh my God, it's exactly the          same!  When I was ten years old, my parents had this very same statue          on the mantle of our apartment. Exactly. And, one day, I grabbed it, and          I was using it as a microphone. I was singing, "MacArthur Park",          and I got to the part about, "I'll never have that recipe again,"          and it slipped out of my hand and it broke. My parents looked at me like          I smashed the ten commandments. To this day, they bring it up. It was          the single most damaging experience in my life, aside from seeing my father          naked.  No, Kramer. I have to have this statue.  What? No dibs! I need this statue. C'mon, give it!  No, no, no potato man.. Inka-dink.  Yeah, good, good.  No, no, no, no.. I'm "it". I win.  (In shock) I can't believe I won at Inka-dink.  No, no, no, I don't want to carry it around all night. I'll pick          it up later.  What?  "It"'s bad?  We can't just let him get away with this.  Forget it? I already called my parents. I told them to expect          the surprise of a lifetime. My mother's making her roasted potatoes!  Who is this Rava?  Let me just call him.  Oh, he stole it?  (To Jerry, without looking at him) I thought you said one o'          clock.  Remember, don't take any crap.  I'll be right here.  (Muttering to himself) I wonder why.  (Muttering) What is he talking about..  (To himself) Yeah, him.  (To himself) You already got it.  (To himself) Take a wild guess.  (To himself) What a mind.  (to himself) I can't believe what I'm hearing.  (To Himself) A pawn shop?  (To himself) And cleaning them out.  (To himself) Again with the Rava.  (Mocking) "Oh, I find you so charming" ..You wuss.  (Muttering to himself) Singapore?! Do you hear this?  I'm the judge and the jury, pal. And the verdict is.. guilty!  GUILTY!  Oh, I'm crazy!  Oh ho! Class, huh? At Columbia? Let me tell you something, pal.          I called the registrar's office. I checked you out. They have no record          of a Ray Thomas at that school! You liar!  You mean alias.  Well, that was bound to happen!  (On the phone) Ma, will you stop?.. It's just a statue! How is          it my fault?! ..It was stolen. I didn't even touch it this time.. Okay,          fine. I don't se why this should affect to potatoes! Okay. Goodbye. (Hangs          up) She doesn't react to disappointement very well.. unlike me.  There's just no justice. This experience has changed me. It's          made me more cynical, more bitter, more jaded.  (Casually) Sure. Why not?  Yeah.. He'll have my parents!  Kramer, I can't believe it. Oh, you're my hero!  I feel like a huge weight's been lifted off my shoulders. (Giddily)          I.. I.. I feel happy! Kramer, I don't know how to thank you!  Jerry! (Slams the door) Georgie's moving out!  I'm out! Fantastic apartment right across                from mine, huh. I can't wait for you to see it.  (Definite) Oh yeah.  You know what? it's better than Elaine's,                too. I gotta give her a call. (Moves tward the phone)  (Stops) Oh right, the blind date.  Come on. Come check out my new place. It'll                take you two minutes.  (Gloating) Hey, you got any extra furniture                down there? I need some more stuff to fill that extra bedroom with                the walk-in closet. (Smiles)  (Laughs as they leave) It's working already!                (Both exit)  (Looks at her) Yeah, uh, no menus. (Waves                her off)  Oh, right! (Shakes her hand) Right! Hey, hey..                I love the floors in here. It's like a gymnasium in here! Try and                guard me! (Dribbles an imaginary ball  (Let down) Yeah, but you - you promised it                to me.  (Depressed) Well,.. the Andrea Doria.. that                was quite a fire. (Moves to the door, leaving)  I remember.. (Leaves)  Hey.  Gone. (Moves over to a chair in the living                room. Kramer takes the carton of food to the table, and begins eating)                The tenant association made me give it  (Talking about his would-be apartment) You                could fit 15 people in that bathroom..  How do you know?  51 people?!  That's no tragedy! How many people do you                lose on a normal cruse? 30? 40?! Kramer, can I take a look at that                book? (Starts walking tward the door.  What's with the dog?  Oh..  A vet?  So, if I may jump ahead - you're gonna take                dog medicine?  Ahoy! Mr. Eldridge. I understand you were                on the Andrea Doria.  I tell ya, I hear people really stuff themselves                on those cruise ships. (Laughs) The buffet, that's the real ordeal,                huh, Clarence? (Laughs)  Well, all vacations have to end eventually.  (Holding up Kramer's book) According to this,                it took.. 10 hours. It eased into the water like an old man into                a nice warm bath - no offence. (Pause) So,  (Yelling out) It's my apartment, Eldridge!                The Stalkholm may not have sunk ya, but I will! Ha, ha, ha!  So, he's keeping the apartment. He doesn't                deserve it, though! Even if he did suffer, that was, like, 40 years                ago! What has he been doing lately?! I've  (Interested) I should!  I could go bumper to bumper with any one else                on this planet!  Nah, I guess I should really get moving on                this, huh? I'm gonna go. (Opens the door, letting Newman in. Leaves)  (On the other line) Hey.  Yeah, listen, I can't make it later.  Yeah, the tenant association has decided to                hear my side of the story. So, uh, I gotta kinda get ready. I'll                see ya.  So, uh, Mom, Dad, I was hoping that you could                help me to remember my childhood a little clearly..  (Pleading for them to stop) Mom.. dad.  (Fed up with his parents) Actually, I think                I'm pretty clear on it.  I was handcuffed to the bed.. In my underwear,                (Sighs) where I remained.. (Scene cuts to another story) She was                attractive.. She was, also, infact, a  It's not contest. The guy had nothing! The                ship went down, he got into a life boat, I mean, come on.  They're making their decision today.  Excuse me, uh, what are you doing in there?  What? Elaine's big-head guy? They have you                the apartment?!  Why?! Because you were stabbed, and.. got                coffee thrown in your face, and.. uh.. (Points to Alan's bandaged                forehead)  That's why they gave you the apartment?  Wait a minute, that is my apartment. I earned                it with 34 years of misery!  We're not dead.  Come on. We got all day tomorrow to come up with a story.  So we'll do it tomorrow.  About six years ago.  Women like skiers.  Yeah. Right.  The closet business? What's the closet business?  I'm interested.  So you thought she was good looking and figured this would                be a good way to meet her.  Yeah. So what happened?  Marla.  Stacey.  Jerry. Marla. (Realizing Jerry's cue) Stacey! (Walks over                to Stacey)  Anyway, we met with NBC about a month ago and they gave                us the green light to go ahead and write a pilot. In fact, we got                a big meeting with them tomorrow. They gotta approve of the story                before we can write.  Not a bad way to make a buck.  Well, I'll tell you, Stacey. It's a lot of hard work. But,                it comes fairly easy to me. Some people write symphonies. This is                my gift. (Raises ski lift ticket while Stacey looks away)  I might.  What? I'm not married. I'm not allowed to go out with somebody                else?  Depends on what?  Like what?  No. Semi-daily. Four or five times a week.  Implied.  There might be some moisturizer.  (Pause) Yeah.  What?  Ah, no, no. Are you sure? A girlfriend?  Would you believe my luck? The first time in my life I                have a good answer to the question, "What do you do?"                and I have a girlfriend. I mean, you don't need a girlfriend when                you can answer that question. That's what you say in order to get                girlfriends. Once you can get a girlfriend, you don't want a girlfriend,                you just want more girlfriends.  Well it's not fair, Jerry. It's just not fair. All right,                all right. That's it. I'm getting out of this thing.  No, what?  Why? What do you mean?  Oh, right. Oh no, man.  Yeah, yeah. I see the irony. All right. What about this?                What if I can find some way to break up with her so that she'll                still like me and it doesn't affect the deal.  Wait, wait. Here me out. Don't dismiss this. You're very                quick to dismiss. Don't dismiss. She's got a big crush on David                Letterman, I mean, a big crush. She talks about him all the time.                Suppose I go up to David Letterman. He works at NBC; I work at NBC.                I explain my situation. He agrees to meet her. They go out, they                fall madly in love. And she dumps me for David Letterman.  No, no. I'm just thinking.  It's George.  She's a virgin?  Wow. So what're you gonna do?  I don't think I could do it. You know, they always remember                the first time. I don't want to be remembered. I wanna be forgotten.  You know, sometimes those guys don't make it back. (Looks                in fridge) I'm really hungry.  We gotta get something. I don't want to go to that meeting                on an empty stomach. Let's get some Chinese. You wanna order it?  What do you want?  I'll tell you what. Why don't we just get a couple of dishes                and we'll just share 'em.  I'm gonna get a Chow Fung.  It's a broad noodle.  It's a big flat noodle.  What kind of noodle do you want?  All right, look. I'm getting the Chow Fung. You don't have                to have any.  Fine.  Where's the food? What happened to Ping?  Hey, what about this? I'm in a car accident. The motorist                is uninsured, you with me?  My car's totaled. It's all his fault and now, he has absolutely                no money. There is no way that he can pay me. So the judge decrees                that he becomes my butler.  Right. He cooks my food, he cleans my house, he does all                my shopping for me. And there you go, that's your program.  Don't worry, we'll find something for you. (Knock of Jerry's                door)  Something happened to the food?  (After looking in the bag) The pea pods? All you saved                was the pea pods? (Kramer enters)  He dropped it.  (To Jerry) We got work to do. What about the meeting?  All right, let's postpone it. Let's get out of here.  I'll fake an illness. (Acts it out) My back! My back! I                can't believe, my back.  I can do this, Jerry.  All right, I'll tell them my sister died. (Starts fake                crying) My poor sister died. She was standing and then she was laughing                and then they SHOT her! That's the kind of sick city that we're                livin' in. They shoot you for laughing. I must go and comfort my                poor family. Jerry, take me home so I can comfort my... my poor                family.  That's David Letterman. I just saw David Letterman walk                by. I'll be right back. (He exits)  You tellin' 'em about the butler story? Is that beautiful                or what? Hey, sorry I'm late. (Looks at Rita) Russell?  Oh, Rita. Hey, Mr. Shermack, how're you doing, good to                see you. Jay, always a pleasure. (To Susan) Sweetie. (Kisses her                and then sits down next to Jerry) Yeah, yeah, that butler idea,                that's beautiful. Isn't that killer? (Aside to Jerry) I thought                I was getting the butler.  No, he said there was nothing he could do, and next time                I should probably break the Prozacs in half.  I bet they're probably doing summersaults about us over                there. You think they get butler stories like that everyday? (He                calls Susan)  Hi, it's me. It's Georgie Boy. What's going on?  Fired? Why?  But I had no... I didn't realize.  I just feel terrible This is just terrible.  (Hangs up phone and pauses) this is great! He fired her!                This is incredible, he fired her. I'm out, baby! I'm out!  Because I kissed her in the meeting. Russell found out,                he fired her over the phone. Finally, my stupidity pays off!  What?  Another job?  Oh, this is unbelievable. I'm stuck. Every time I think                I'm out, they pull me back in.   What do I do? Well actually, I'm a writer. In fact, I'm                writing a comedy pilot for NBC right now.  Say you, me, and Kramer are, uh, flying over                the Andes.  We got a soccer game in Chile. Anyway, the                plane crashes. Who are you gonna eat to survive?  So fast? What about me?  Kramer's so stringy. I'm plump, juicy.  Well I would eat you.  I still don't see why you wouldn't eat me.                I'm your best friend.  Thank you.  No.  With me or in general?  Nucleosis.  No, no, pff...  Yeah, six weeks.  I can do six weeks standin' on my head. I'm                a sexual camel. That's not the point. At least there was the possibility.  I don't know. I don't wanna be one of those                guys.  Like us. (Elaine enters)  So it's just mono.  No something is bunk and then you debunk it.  I think. (Pause as they all look down)  They asked you to do career day?  Oh with all due respect, I went there too,                and I work for a team that just won the World Series.  It was fantastic, Jerry. We wound up talking                all night.  you know, just by conversing, you can really                learn a lot about a person.   You got bumped from career day?  Hey, hey. Kramer, what are you doing? You                can't smoke in here.  What is Pericles?  Who is Sir Arthur Conan Doyle?  What is Borax?  What is Tungsten or Wolfram?  No, no, no. Just lately, I've been thinking                a lot clearer. Like this afternoon, (To television) what is chicken                Kiev, (Back to Jerry) I really enjoyed watching a documentary with                Louise.  You think?  Oh my God. I just remembered where I left                my retainer in second grade. I'll see ya. (He throws finished Rubik's                cube to Jerry and he exits. Kramer enters)  Of course. Absolute zero!  I stopped having sex.  Guys, hitting is not about muscle. It's simple                physics. Calculate the velocity, v, in relation to the trajectory,                t, in which g, gravity, of course remains a constant. (Hits a home                run) It's not complicated.  George Costanza, assistant to the traveling                secretary.  Do you wanna talk about hotels, or do you                wanna win some ball games?  In six games.  Nine minutes.  Hello? I can take an hour off your hands.                Give the kids a chance to see a real live Yankee.  Excuse me, darling, do I detect a Portuguese                accent?  Das kaffes un salat e grand por favor.  Eh, don't mention it.  Yeah, my cleaning lady's Portuguese. I must've                picked it up.  I told her I would have to think about it.  I don't know. Perhaps I can better serve the                world this way.  Simple joke from a simple man.   Well, Jerry. There was a pretty good chance                I was never gonna have sex again anyway.  Oh, sports are so pedestrian. I've prepared                some science experiments that will illuminate the mind and dazzle                the eye.  You know, Louise. I think you'll find this                amusing. In early Euclidean geometry--  I used to share that same outlook. But now,                I have so many things to occupy my mind. For instance, the atom.  What a fascinating turn of events. (Waitress                approaches)  Ah. Sim, por favor.  Hey.  I got lost on the way over.  What are these? (Holds test tubes to his head                like antennae) Take me to your leader.  No, the Portuguese waitress.  I calculated my odds of ever getting together                with a Portuguese waitress. Mathematically, I had to do it, Jerry.  No, no. I'm not going on.   Tell you about the Portuguese waitress.  (Slowly shakes his head) My mother caught me.  You know. (All three give him blank stares) I was alone..  (Nods) Uh-huh.  (Not really wanting to embellish) ..I stopped by the house                to drop the car off, and I went inside for a few minutes.. Nobody                was there - they're supposed  ..So, one thing lead to another..  First she screams, "George, what are you doing?! My                God!" And it looked like she was gonna faint - she started                clutching the wall, trying to hang onto it.  I didn't know whether to try and keep her from falling,                or zip up.  I zipped up!  Yeah. (Noticing this makes him out to be the bad kid, he                gets defensive) Well, I couldn't run over there the way I was!  So, she fell, and then she started screaming, "My                back! My back!" So, I picked her up and took her to the hospital.  (Somewhat angered) She's in traction.  It's not funny, Elaine.  Her back went out. She's gotta be there for a couple of                days. All she said on the way over in the car was, "Why, George,                why?!".. I said, "Because it's  (Vowing) Well, I'll tell you this, though - I am never                doing.. that , again.  (Definite) All together.  You don't think I can?  (Daring) You think you could?  Care to make it interesting?  A hundred dollars.  Alright, look, you want to be in?  You gotta give us odds. At least two to one - you gotta                put up two-hundred dollars.  Alright, you're in for one-fifty.  Alright, now, how are we gonna monitor this thing?  (Stern) No, ma, I'm not gonna see a psychiatrist. N- I                don't care if you do pay for it! No! Discussion over. Yeah, alright,                I'll see you later. Yes, of course  (Defensively) Whatever.  (Shrugging it off) She'll be fine. I gotta go to the hospital                to see her tonight.  Hey, what are you doing tonight?  Oh, the virgin?  Any, uh.. progress, there? What's the latest?  (In awe) Wow!  (Suggesting) Maybe she's a nudist. You know, those nudist                colony people..  I would imagine it's all naked.  (Still focused on the nudist) They're naked, the gardeners                naked.. the bellhops. (Jerry makes a noise of astonishment) One                big nude-a-rama.  (Also, over his shoulder) Not me.  Have a good time.  You're out?!  (Stern, trying to shut her up) Ma.  Ma, people can hear you.  (Getting up) Alright, Ma, that's enough!  No! I am not going to see a psychiatrist!  (Like a kid) Because I don't want to.  Well, I am not going.  (Snapping) Is that important, really? What is this, a police                investigation? The woman's been through enough. She has to relive                the experience now?!  (Slowly backing away, he's not at all committed to the                conversation) Yeah.. television.  Every night at six-thirty. The nurse was gorgeous.. then                I got a look at the patient.. (Laughs, then snorts) I was going                nuts.  (Fake sympathy) Well, my mother, Jerry..  (Arms out) I am king of the county. You?  "Quite a workout"? What did you say?  Of course I'm back. Why wouldn't I be back? My mother's                in the hospital, I'm going to pay her a visit.  You're my mother! What wouldn't I do for you?  (Smiling) You got it, Ma. (She smiles back, nodding) A                little later. (George sits back in a nearby chair, looking at the                divider in anticipation)  Well, wait a little while, Ma. What's the difference?  (Standing up) I just got here, Ma! I'd like to spend a                little time with you.  Ten minutes! Here, here, (Fishes a box of Tic-Tacs out                of his coat pocket and tosses them to her) Have some Tic-Tacs.  (Muttering, slow) Hang on, Ma.. hang on..  All you got is instant coffee? Why don't you get some real                coffee?  Where did you get those socks?  I think those are my socks!  I don't know, but those are my socks! I had a pair just                like that with the blue stripe, and now I don't have them anymore!  Yeah, well, they're my socks!  Oh boy..  ..Oh boy.  Do you believe this? We're fighting. We're fighting.  Me too. I've been yelling at strangers on the street.  (Shocked) You caved?!  You're out?  I figured you'd cruise. At least through the Spring.  And then, (Smacks the money) there were two.  (To Elaine) Hey, what happened?  I thought you were meeting Kennedy.  Yeah, he did.  No, no, no. He just left.  Yeah, he was talking to Marla.  Yeah, I think, you know, she was, like, crying, and he                was consoling her, and then, she, uh, just got into his car, and                they just drove away.  Yeah.  Yeah, drove away.. You know, I said 'Hello' to him. You                know, he's - he's-  Kramer?!  You know I uh, spilled a yohgurt smoothie in here two days                ago. Can't smell anything, can   Right.  Oh they'll get out of the way. You really smell banana?  So uh where are we eating?  What ever they had. Miranda thinks I'm a butcher but it's                not my fault is it? Don't we have a deal with the pigeons?  Right! And these pigeons broke the deal. I will not accept                the blame for this.  I'm getting nothing.  Really? I thought you and Celia were sleeping together?  I don't understand women.  Hey <sees coffee marks> Art Garfunkle?  Right.  We had a deal!  Jerry?   Well, it happened again.  Well, I just stomped some pigeons in the park. They - they                didn't move.  I I don't get these birds! They're breaking the deal. It's                like the pigeons decided to ignore me!  Boy that bank clock is eight minutes off.  Zing.  Did you see that? That-that pigeon didn't move! I had to                swerve to get out of the way! I saved   Squirrel? Well, we have no deal with THEM!  Well, uh, are there any other options?  What might that cost?  Well? <Miranda hits George> I was just - I'm curious,                that's all. We, uh. we'd like you to do   yeah. yeah. I know.  So they're flying the tiny instruments in from El Paso.  Oh, come on! You gotta get me over there!  More wine and turkey? <Pours Celia more wine>  Four hours.  <playing with toys> Yes! Touch down! Your turn, Jerry.              Is he dead?  What's that?  He has no home. He's a squirrel.  It's not a pet! It's a wild invalid! And it knows that                I tried to kill it. As soon as it gets better, it's   That's perfect! He's a zoo guy! He take's care of animals.                Can I bring the squirrel by?  I gotta get to Fowler. I know that he would take this squirrel                off my hands. It's practically   Boy, my knuckles are still cramped from that football game.  Hey, last night, I found a whole Weeble Village right behind                the EZ Bake oven.  Oh, me, me, me, me, me!  Oh, don't look. This is the part where they change me.  I was seven and a half.  Mister Fowler, I have a squirrel here that is a miracle                of modern science!  Well, at least we know the prosthetic squirrel hips work                ... sorry about the set.  Yeah, he's in my bed. I'm sleeping on the couch.  Still getting nothing! So go ahead pigeons. Laugh it up.                I'm getting in my car now and the last   Hey! what are listening to?  Oh! you taped it?  Hey! Did 'ya ever do that thing on the toes that I said                .   Yeah! like the big toe is like the captain of the toes,                but sometimes the toe next to the big toe gets so  Yeah. Did you do it?  So?  Need to use the phone.  China.  Yeah.

Hello!! Hello. i..i..is this the hair                restoration clinic? ...Does anyone speak English?  Do you speak English?...English!!  English. Does anybody speak English .Nobody speaks English.  In this scene my co-star who's right over here ( goes over                to George who is still on the phone)  (visibly disturbed) I...I..I dunno.

That was really funny.  From China. All the way from China.  No Don't get the camera , we don't need the camera. Listen                I know your skeptical , but I really believe  Why do you have to be so suspicious of every one. This                is a great man Zeng Zau, he wants to help bald people.  All right, all right ( Goes to the bathroom)  All day. ( phone rings , Jerry picks up)  Is that Elaine?  HI ELAINE...  Did she say Hello?  I mean , when I said Hello did she say Hello back?  Isn't polite to say Hello when somebody says hello?  Elaine's coming up?  Yeah, that was enough.  No No I'm working on a system...Who was that?  It's George.  I have to talk to you about something .  Aahh..No..No..  I can't tell ya now , he's gonna be back in a ten seconds.  I can't.  All right.........I've become attracted to Elaine..  Kramer, can we do this later..  Really? ..You think.  So now you're doing my bits?  NO!!  I can't say.  Because I promised her.  She doesn't.  Because she asked me to.  All right You really want to know?...It all started when                she told met hat...she was the voice  Yeah! She made me promise not to tell you .It's supposed                to be a joke.  Well let me hear....( they struggle for the headphones)                You heard it fifty times already.  ( Yelling from the bathroom) Don't tell her anything ,                she'll kill me!!  He..He threatened me.  Elaine.. I have to tell you something...  No no no no no no no..  I'm very attracted to you..  Ever since I found out that you let that message on Jerry's                tape recorder I...  Heuh. huh. Stick around a while.  Are you through? [kind of irritated]  Yes, it was purple, I liked it, I don't actually recall                considering the buttons.  [pretends he's talking into a microphone] Uh, no, not at                this time.  Are, are you sure this is decaf? Where's the orange indicator?  How come you're not doin' the second show tomorrow?  Wait a second, wait a second, what coming in, what woman                is coming in?  No, you didn't!  Wait wait wait, what is she, [takes the milk can from Jerry                and puts it on the table] what is she like?  [with a big smile] So, ya know, what, what happened?  Oh, nothing happened, but it was...  This is great!  So, ya know, she calls and says she wants to go out with                you tomorrow night? God bless! Devil you!  [whistles disapproving] Ho ho ho, "Had to"? "Had                to come in"?  "Had to come in" and "maybe we'll get together"?                "Had to" and "Maybe"?  No...no...no, I hate to tell you this: you're not gonna                see this woman.  How do I know, maybe, ya know, maybe she wanted to be polite.                All right, all right, I didn't want to tell you this, you                wanna know why she called you?  You're a back-up, you're a second-line, a just-in-case,                a B-plan of contingency!  [The waitress(Claire) passes the table; George stops her                and writes something on his note-block] Claire, Claire, you're a                woman, right?  Uhm...I'd like to ask you...ask you to analyze a hypothetical                phone call, ya know, from a female point of view.  [to Claire] Now, a woman calls me, all right? She says                she has to [makes some gestures to accent "has to"] come                to New York on business...  and, and maybe [again some gestures] she'll see me when                she gets there, does this woman intend to spend time with me?  [to Claire] So why did she call?  To be polite, I rest my case.  I'm not gonna watch you do laundry.  Come on, I'm tired.  [takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes; panics] Right,                I knew I felt something...! [Jerry is laughing, Claire walks away                with a smile]  Jerry? I have to tell ya somethin':...this is the dullest                moment I've ever experienced. [walks away from the dryer; a man                passes George and Jerry]  I need a break, Jerry, ya know, I gotta get out of the                city, I feel so cramped...  What?!  I can't believe: [falls on his knees] WE ALREADY DISCUSSED                THIS!  [gets up] 'Cause it's signals, Jerry [starts snapping his                fingers], it's signals! Don't you....all right. Did she even ask                you, what you were doin' tomorrow night, if you were busy?  She calls you today and she doesn't make a plan for tomorrow?                What is that? It's Saturday night!  What is that? It's ridiculous! [Jerry bobs agreeingly]                You don't even know, what hotel she's staying at, you can't call                her. That's a signal, Jerry, that's a signal! [snaps his fingers                again] Signal!  Maybe I'm right? Of course I'm right.  [puts an arm around Jerry and whispers] I know, I know.                [normal voice] Listen, your stuff has to be done by know, why don't                you just see if it's dried?  You're gonna "overdry" it.  Why not?  [looks at the other persons in the laundry and says to                them pointing to Jerry] Any questions?  [points to the dryer] Look at that: they're done! It's                a miracle! [Jerry looks surprised]  Ya know, I can't believe you're bringin' in an extra bed                for woman, that wants to sleep with you. Why don't you bring in                an extra guy too? [sits down]  All right, all right, one more time, one more time! What                was the EXACT phrasing of the request?  A decent hotel-room...  You can't be serious. This is New York city: there must                be eleven million decent hotel-rooms! Whatta ya need? A flag? [waves                with his handkerchief] This is the signal, Jerry, this is the signal!  I think I was affected by the caffeine. [suddenly a dog                enters the apartment and jumps George at the couch] HO, HO, HO,                GOOD DOG [etc.]  [ironically] Well, that's flattering.   Right, can we go? 'Cause I'm double-parked, I'm gonna get                a ticket.  So what? That's good.  Because filth is good...Whatta you think: rock stars have                sponges and ammonia lyin' around the bathroom? They, they have a                woman comin' over: "I've gotta tidy up? Yeah right, in these                matters you never do what your instincts tell you. Always, ALWAYS                do the opposite.  Yeah, I wish.  Yeah.  Well, I might be getting in to that.  I'm aware of you, all right, let's go [opens the bathroom                door], let's go! [Jerry and the dog come out] You're on stage in                25 minutes.  What a world that would be, if you just could ask a woman                what she's thinkin'.  Listen, listen, don't get worked up, 'cause you're gonna                know the whole story the minute she steps off the plane.  'Cause it's all in the greeting.   All right, if she puts the bags down before she greets                you, that's a good sign.  Ya know, anything in the, in the "lip-area" is                good.  Ya know a hug: definitely good.  Sure.  That's so brutal, I hate that.  That's why, ya know, a shake is bad.  Hand-sandwich.  I see, well, that's open to interpretation. Because so                much depends on the layering and the quality of the wetness in the                eyes...[suddenly a woman approaches Jerry from behind and puts her                hands over Jerry's eyes]  Hi, how are you?  Laura, sure.  Yes, the "surprise-blindfold-greeting". That                wasn't in the manual, I don't know.  I loved her Jerry, I loved her.   And she loved me. Hoo, ho, she really did.  What am I going to do now? I can't live without Susan.              I gotta get her back. How? How, am I gonna get her back?  Who says?   Ah, ...A beautiful successful intelligent woman's in love                with me and I throw it all away. uh oh boy. Now I'll spend the rest                of my life living alone. I'll sit in my disgusting little apartment                watching basketball games, eating Chinese take out. Walking around              with no underwear. Because I'm too lazy to do a laundry.  Yeah, what do you do when you run out of laundry?  Who am I going to meet who is better than her? No one,              Jerry. No one's better than her.  I loved her!   I would give anything to be going up those stairs again.              I gotta call her. Should I call her?  Whyie?  I'm not going to see that nut doctor she went to Europe              with.  She any good?  Wa, uh, ...  My Darling Susan! My DARLING!!!   My little man doesn't know.  My little man's an idiot.  She kept such a nice clean apartment. She was so sanitary.              She made a big breakfast every Sunday. I don't know what              she put in those eggs.   (singing) Oh hey, if you happen to see the most beautiful                girl who walked out on me. Tell her I'm sorry. Tell her I need my              baby ... oh won't you tell her ... I love her. Oh hey, ...  Well hello. Um, ah, specifically the reason that I'm here,                uh, I don't know uh what Elaine told you but uh I broke up with                my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago. Actually she broke up with                me [struggling with his coat zipper] and uh, well, I was the cause                of it and uh, I just wanted to find out from you ... What's with              this thing?  Yeah, and, ... Why won't this go down?   What is with this damn zipper?  It's stuck on a piece of cloth here. I can't get the cloth              out.  This is a brand new jacket. Boy this really burns me up,              ...  ... Susan.  UH, ha ha, ... It's just SO frustrating. It's a brand new              jacket.  Pull it up a little bit.  Yeah, okey, wait wait. That will separate.   Take it right off the chest...  You're gonna rip it. You're gonna rip it.  Okay. Uh, my mother is is going to pay for the sessions.              ... Oh,Elaine?  [stares at card]  Was it a scratch or a pick?   Hey. It's me.  Was there any nostril penetration?  So let's say in her mind she witnessed a pick. Okay, so              then what?  I guarantee you that Moses was a picker. You wander throughh                the desert for forty years with that dry air. ... You telling me              you're not going to have occasion to clean house a little bit.   No. That's disgusting!   Hey. How come I didn't get a Christmas card? Everybody                else got one. Jerry got one, Kramer got one. I thought we were good              friends. I don't get a Christmas card. I don't get it.   Why don't you call her agency. Maybe she's been out of              town and she didn't get the calls.   It'll be different this time.   I'm not stable? I'm like a rock. I take these glasses off,                you can't tell the difference between me and a rock. I put these                glasses on a rock. You know what jumps into most people's minds?              Costanza!   I change I change. Two weeks ago I tried a soft boiled                egg. Never liked it before. Now I'm dunkin a piece of toast in there              and I'm loving it.   And I am not a piece of toast.   That's okay. That's good. You think Louie Pasteur and his                wife had anything in common? He was in the fields all day with the                cows, you know with the milk, examining the milk, delving into milk,                consummed with milk. Pasteurization, Homogenization, She was in              the kitchen killing cockroaches with a boot on each hand.   Because. There was a lot of cake lying around the house.                Just sitting there going with all the excess milk from all the experiments              [grins]   Yes! Yes. You know. She didn't know about Pasteurization.              He didn't know anout Fumigation. But they made it work!  She comes out of the bathroom, I'm in up to my wrist. You              should have seen the look on her face.   Your buttocks are spectacular.   Mario's Pizza.  Just as she was. Hey, Mario! Remember us?  We'll have 2 slices and 2 grape sodas.  Hey, Jerry, remember Frogger? I used to be so into this                game. Gettin' that frog across the street was my entire life.  Double jump! Eat the fly! Eat it!  Ah, beat it, punk.  Yes! 860,000. I can't believe it's still standing. No one                has beaten me in like 10 years.  The perfect combination of Mountain Dew and mozzarella...just                the right amount of grease on the joy stick...  Yeah.  Oh! Here you are. Ha ha...You, uh, you want to--  Well, I'm doing it, Jerry. I'm buying the Frogger machine.                Now the torch will burn forever.  So, you want to come down to Mario's Pizza with me and                help me pick up the Frogger?  What?  You're right. Why must there always be a problem? You'd                think just once I could get a break. God knows I earned it with                that score!  No. I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that                I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score.                H-hello?  Well, is he good, Kramer?  Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If                I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me.  Slippery Pete?  All right, I'm gonna find a guy with a truck. GLC must                live on!  So you slept with her?  And you automatically sleep with her?  Finished your thought.  An ostrich burger.  You know, they say ostrich has less fat, but you eat more                of it.  What's that?  Now, each of you is here because you're the best at what                you do.  Slippery Pete, Kramer tells me you are one hell of a rogue                electrician. And shlomo, you're the best truck driver.  Oh...you're very good.  Ok. Good. And Kramer, you're in charge of taping off the                loading zone.  All right, all right, calm down, calm down. Whatever happened                in the past is past.  Now, this is the basic layout for Mario's Pizza.  What do you mean?  No. I--I paid for it.  We're not stealing it.  All right, let's--let's focus. Can we get back to the plan?  Fine. Steal the battery. Now, all right, here is the Frogger.                This is the front door, and this is the outlet.  The outlet?  That's where the electricity comes out.  Uh, here.  The Frogger is here.  All right. You understand now? It's not that complicated.  Jerry, you came for the big moment.  Ha ha. Everything's timed out to perfection, Jerry. Slippery                Pete's got the Frogger running on battery power, the truck will                be there any minute, and Kramer's taped out the loading zone.  Yeah, yeah. You gotta come over tonight. We can play.  Where?  I hear thee.  What are you guys doing?  You idiots. You're gonna wear down the battery.  Quick. Get this thing back in the pizzeria  I need an outlet!  Holes! I need holes!  All right. Kramer, you block off traffic. You to go sweet-talk                the pharmacist.  Wait a minute. This looks familiar. This reminds me of                something. I can do this.  Jerry, I've been preparing for this moment my entire life.  So, I'm uh, I'm afraid we're going to have to pass.  Well, it's . . . much too low.   Ah, yeah, . . . I believe I can speak for the both of us on this.  Standard?   Is Ted Danson's deal standard?   You know, the guy from Cheers.  I didn't say I was Ted Danson.  -   Oh, uh, do I have to write him a note or something?   But what do I say in the note?  Oh, uh, yeah, I'm a writer, (laughs)  That's the one your parents bought you?  Jerry, my young friend, you are so nave. You are so so nave.          You know about a few things. You know about comedy, a little bit about          relationships, some baseball, but you are so far out of your element here,          you are embarrassing yourself. Now listen to me. I am negotiating. Negotiation,          this is what you do in business.   Ooooo, I'm scared. . . . Ooooo they're not going to do the show.          Oooo what are we going to do? I'm shaking!

No, no you really look great.  Yeah, I saw it.  You almost did the nose.  I'm not eating bread now. I'm off bread.  What do you mean - "Not letting you?"  Svengali.  Svenjolly.  You know what you should do? You should tell this guy you're          seeing somebody else. That's the easiest way to get out of these things.  Well, you just tell him an old boyfriend has come back into your          life.  Took a shot.  Look at that. They got lobster on the menu. Who would order                a  You know, I think we really need to be in front of a television                set.  An eye job? Ma, you don't need an eye job.  No, you're not a divorcee.

I'll just go back to my usual routine.  Supposed to close with the swirl?  Yeah, yeah, should've written it down.  What's to think about? If Putty says it's what it is, it's                what it  What happened to Putty?  Well, of course they're trying to screw you. What do you                think?  Let me ask you a question. This new move. Is there a knuckle  I think that's mine.  All right, listen, I'll see you guys later.  It just came to me.  You mean in the end?  A counter-clockwise swirl.  What?  Nothing. I don't know...just a little dirt.  It's a very complicated move! I couldn't remember it all.  You know, it's not the S.A.T.s!  They say this guy's the best.  [stands up] I am.  Ma, don't cry!  Ma, your eyes!  March 21st. Hey! So, you're gonna back me on this, right?  You are a good friend. You know what? Even if you killed somebody          I wouldn't turn you in.  Hi,   Good, good day.

You see those tears streaming down you don't know what to do.          It was like she was on fire and I was trying to put her out.   I didn't have any sex.  I didn't have make-up sex.  Yeah, conjugal visit sex. That is happening!   Did you here that? I can't believe this he's eating his sandwich.  This is amazing. [George gets up to leave and shake's man's hand]          Thank you. Thank you very much. . . . I'm going back in! . . . You'll          feel better [to woman]  Good, good day. How was your day?  Oh, nothing much. You know, I went over to Jerry's.

Hello there. I'm George Costanza.  Assistant to the travelling secretary. (fishing for a reaction)          Payroll project. Wilhelm? Big uh, big payroll project.  You know what, I'll just uh, I'll just look around for a little          Look, I am under direct orders from Mr Wilhelm. So if you have          (spotting possible salvation) You know what, I urge you to take          So he explained it all to you?  What'd he tell you?  (standing) Yes, payroll. Yes I did. Very productive. Payroll...          Oh, yeah. Downtown. Definitely.  (to himself) Yeah, you said it. (to Wilhelm) Uh, excuse me, Mr          The song?  (thoughtful) Downtown.  Yeah.  I think he was trying to tell me something, like it had some          'When you're alone, and life is making you lonely, you can   'Maybe you know some little places to go, where they never   Wait a second. 'Little places to go, where they never close.'          'Just listen to the music of the traffic, in the city. Linger          'The lights are much brighter there. You can forget all your          'Things'll be great, when you're...'  I got nothing, Jerry. Nothing.  You think I should come clean? What d'you think, you think I          I don't think we should see each other anymore. You're                great but I'm I'm riddled with   Nothing It's not you. It's me. I have a fear of commitment.                I don't know how to love.   No, no,  I love the chop sticks. I, I personally prefer a fork but                they look very nice.   I have a fear of intimacy   Nothing. It's not YOU..  The truth. you want the truth? It is your earrings It is                the chopsticks but it's so much   I, I think I made my point. I'm sorry if I was a little                harsh.   Can I uh, can I walk you back to work?  Oh, please ... ... four dollars is f...  George   My whole life has been a complete waste of time, <chuckle>  Now I know what I am supposed to do. It's so simple.   Oh, oh, your papers  No. I did.   ...I broke up with her.   I broke up with her.   It's OK. It's fine. She'll do it. I'm sure she'll still                do it.   Oh, no. We left on good terms.   Because I uh, I told her the truth.   It's OK.  She asked me to.  I told her that she was pretentious.   Like what? What could they say?  Like what? I'm bald? What is it specifically? Is, is there                an odor I'm not aware of?  Give me one.  Yes.  I'm cheap? You think I'm CHEAP? How could you say that                to me? I can't  You should have lied.  When I was working I spent baby.   She put them in her pocketbook. I guess she took them with                her.  Give me the phone. <dials> Yea, Hi I would like to                speak to Patrice. ...  She never came back from lunch.   <dials> Hi, are you OK? no, no,.. huh, <hangs                up> She hung up.   All right. There's nothing to be worried about. She's just                a little  No, no she wasn't.  No, I didn't.  A mental institution.   It's not really a mental institution. It's more like a                depression  Her roommate. I've driven women to lesbianism before but                never to a mental institution.   She put them in her pocket book. She probably took them                out there with her.  I don't know.   Where?  We could.   I'm very nervous about this. I've never spoken to a mental                patient before.   I should be in a place like this I envy this woman. Ya'                get to wear  Potato  Blanket  Grass  Oh, boy. Here she comes.  Oh, this is my friend Jerry.  Pretentious? Who isn't pretentious? Ha, ha, if everyone                who was  No, that's not it at all.  Uh, we're cool. Everything's cool (to security attendent)  All righty, no reason for us to uh, raise our voices.   What I said? I saw stupid things all the time I can't go                two minutes without saying stupid things.  You should be the one criticizing me. I, I'm lucky to even                know someone like you.   Of course I mean that. I am incapable of guile.   I'm going to a poetry reading with PATRICE: First time                poets, in a burnt out building, down by the docks,   Hey, I'm getting in on that.  You're going that way anyway!   Party?  Food?  Bar?  George?  How could I possibly interfere?  (Eating) Oh yeah. These are fantastic, fantastic. (To server)                You know,  My name is George.  No, I'm a friend of Elaine Benes.  So...  Sweet Fancy Moses!  Food was good.  Well, actually you did miss one nugget of entertainment.                (Pause) Have you  It was more like a full bodied dry heave set to music.  What, you mean you know about this?  Well, sometimes you can't help these people 'til they hit                rock bottom.  Hey, you gotta take a ride with me later. I borrowed my                father's car. '68  During that period when my folks were separated he went                a little crazy.  So this Anna called me from out of the blue.  With extreme prejudice.  No, no. That's just the thing. Anna told me that Elaine                said I was one of  I'm the bad boy. I've never been the bad boy.  Yes, yes...  Okay, the point is made.  No one's putting a gun to your head. Do I, uh, scare you?  Yeah, she's a sweet ride.  Maybe.  Guess not.  I didn't do nothin'.  Lighten up.  Yo, Anna.  (Ironing) You don't wanna know.  What're you talkin' about?  Pick up the phone, Elaine. Pick it up!  Pick it up, pick it up!  Elaine, get off the speaker! (Elaine picks up phone)  You are ruinin' everything.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it. More of that, difficult.                I'm a  I'm a bad man!  Well, I'm the good boy again. Can you believe that?  Anna actually has respect for me now. It's all over.  Did you say dangerous?  I'm a bootlegger.  I'm bootleggin' a movie, baby!  I can do hard time for this one. And community service!  (Takes it and throws it out window) Get outta my way!  Why did the policeman have to yell at me like that? (Elaine                enters)  Oh my God.  Ow! Dad...  Where were you?  Well you know, if you were sitting right next to her you'd have          to console her no matter what.   When you're talking about a movie like "Beaches", moving          from the chair to the couch , . . . that's quite a voyage.  Hey. I gotta go.  I didn't know you were such a Bette Midler fan.  Gennice palying today?  Going backstage is the worst. Especially when they stink. You          know that's a real problem.  Yeah, he once bumped into reverend Yung Sun Moon.   I watched "Beaches" on cable last night. (wings?)           Give me a break.  Aaaaaah  come on it's just a game.  So what? Somebody dropped an egg on my head as I went into my          building last night.  You heard him.  Oh, yeah. I read what you said to the papers yesterday. You weren't          in on the planing. What planning? YOU THINK WE PLANED THIS? Uh?   Who are you to decide?  Hey, look, Kramer,  O.K., Danny, take a swing. <Tartabull swings the bat.>          N-No! No! No! You're opening up your shoulder.  No, not really. I'm just saying this to you because I like to          hear myself talk. Yes, really!  What are all sweatin' for?  Hot? <Feels Tartabull's material.> What is this?  This uniform, what's it made from?  No. This is not cotton. Here, lemme see. <Tries to look at          the tag on the uniform. Tartabull gets creeped out and resists.> Will          you stop it? <Looks at the tag.> Oh. Of course. Polyester!   I can't believe you're not playing in cotton.  You know they used to make leisure suits out of this fabric?  Of course! Alright, maybe I'll say something to Buck.  Hey, don't embarrass me today. I got some friends in the stands.          <George makes a swinging motion with an imaginary bat and pulls something          in his back.>  Miss Rhode Island? When are you seeing her?  You're incredible.  What if she becomes Miss America? You could be dating Miss America,          Jerry!  Chaperone? What, are you kidding?  What does the chaperone do?  Can she talk?  You're calling her?  Hey, did you know that the Yankees don't wear cotton jerseys?  Well, what is that? That's a crime! Do you know how hot those          things get? They should be wearing cotton.  I don't know. That's all gonna change.  Why shouldn't I?  How do you know?  Hey, Buck. Talk to you for a second?  How's everything going? Everything O.K.?  Listen, Buck, I uh...obviously I don't need to talk to you about          the importance of player morale, but uh...I've been talking to some of          the guys, and some of them - I don't want to mention any names - but some          of them...they're not too happy with the polyester uniforms.  Well, they get very hot in the polyester. You know, it's not          a natural fibre. I think they would prefer cotton.  Yeah. Cotton breathes, you see, it's much softer. Imagine playing          games and your team is five degrees cooler than the other team. Don't          you think that would be an advantage? They're cooler, they're more comfortable...they're          happier - they're gonna play better.  Oh - I've got something.  Well, did you see it?  The uniforms! Did you see how they played? Listen to these comments!          (reads from the paper) "Wade Boggs: 'What a fabric! Finally we can          breathe.' Luis Palonia: 'Cotton is king.' Paul O'Neill: 'I never dreamed          anything could be so soft and fluffy.' "  Really!  Atlantic City? (thinks) Yes! Yes! I will go to Atlantic City.          I'm in. I'm down.  Hey.   How was the show?  I won fifty bucks! Boy, this is great. Too bad Elaine's not here.  I don't know, it sounds like pigeons or something!  Me either. Is there anything you can do to shut them up?  Good night, Stan.  Oh. <Goes back into the bathroom.>  That's a shame. <Karen is shown singing off-key on the television.>  Hey, hey! Yankee game! <Changes the channel.>  Yeah, here you go.  A dry-cleaning bill?  Yeah.  For vomiting on her vest!  Well, I shouldn't have to pay for it!  Eighteen dollars.  I don't know.  What's Yo-yo Ma?  All right, come on, come on, let's go. Six dollars.  I know!  The show! Forget about the show! We should take the idea to a          different network  It was a good idea. Susan liked it. Now, if he hadn't vomitted          all over her, we'd be writing it right now.  Anyway.  What?  They wanna have another meeting? They wanna buy it?! They wanna          but it?! Oh! I tell you! We're gonna be rich!! What are we gonna get for          this? Fifty, sixty thousand?  Oh, it's gotta be fifty! Hee hee! You know how much Ted Danson          makes, huh?  I didn't say 'We're Ted Danson.'  Oh!  Yeah, don't worry. He can afford it.  What, is that the one your parents gave you?  All right, we'll be a little late, I,m not taking a cab.  It's not the money!  I didn't shave this morning. I don't feel like myself.  Look at this.  'Cause I shaved yesterday in the afternoon.  Because of the day before. It's a long story.   It's not him!  Mister Seinfeld? What about Mister Costanza? I'm not here?  Okay. A little.  The story is the foundation of all entertainment. You must have          a good story otherwise it's just masturbation.  Care? Forget about care. Love. They have to love the characters.          Otherwise, why would they keep tuning in?  Would they tune in?  The show will be like a heart attack!  Is-is that what I said 'no story'? Because Jerry had to tell          me later.  Well, we would like to be in business. Let's do business. We'll          have some business. Let's have business.  Yeah!  Oh, oh. Uh, you know. It's the damndest thing. I, uh, I moved          recently and my files, pfff, disappeared. Now, I-I don't know if they          fell off the truck or if there was some sort of foul play but let me tell          you something. I'm not through with that moving company.  That's my vow to you.  Oh! That's good judgment. That's a pile of judgment there. Sure.  See?  I told you, I told you! Ha ha ha! Ooh ooh!  Yes! How're we gonna do that?  Oh, thank you.  Thanks. Gee, you know, I thought you were mad at me.  When you sent me the-the bill for the dry-cleaning. I thought          the show didn't have a chance.  Anyway, I-I would like to-to pay for the cleaning.  No-no-no, we all chipped in. We have the money.  Okay, uh, eighteen dollars, and there it is. There you go. So          maybe we could get together this weekend.  All right, great.  I offered to pay. She should've said no.  Maybe this is what the pilot should be about, vomiting on somebody's          vest.  How much are we gonna get for this? Fifty, sixty thousand?  Oh, gotta get fifty. Gotta get fifty. All right, I tell you what.          We go to the coffee shop, you call your manager. Maybe they made an offer.  Thirteen thousand?  a piece?  That's insulting! Ted Danson makes eight hundred thousand dollars          an episode.  Well, he does.  I'm sorry. I can't live knowing Ted Danson makes that much more          than me. Who is he?  What about me?  Why him? Why not me?  I'm better than him.  I can't go out there, he knows we're friends.  Tell the cop.  I thought you said he was gonna get a muffin.  I thought he was just gonna have a muffin.  You know, a muffin can be very filling.  I'm not* sure.  All right. I don't.  What's with this guy?  Muffin, sandwich and coffee!  What's the difference? The money is not important.  Ah, get outta here. The vomiting is much funnier.  No, YOU do!  Man, I'm starving.  Because ballpark food doesn't count as real food.  Those nachos are killing me.  It's complicated.  So I saw that new movie about the Hindenburg.  Blimp: The Hindenburg Story.  I found it morose. Why dwell on these negative themes?  Anyway, right in the middle, the ship blows up-- burning                debris, bodies falling-- and then just as this eerie silence settles                over the airfield, I yelled out, "That's gotta hurt!"  The place went nuts.  Yeah.  What's with all these flags?  I could have had some ice cream. I think that might have                calmed down the nachos.  Just inch over. You worm your way.  My hand is out.  This guy's giving me the stare-ahead.  Look at me! I am man! I am you!  All right, he's letting you in. Thank you! Creep.  All right! We're here!  Yeah. I'll see you later.  The movies. Blimp is playing right there.  It's a performance, Jerry. Like what you do.  Isn't it?  Ladies. I, uh, I haven't seen this before.  Excuse me, are you the guy with that funny laser?  Yeah. The thing is, I, uh...I had this little zinger of                my own I wanted to try.  It's right in the explosion scene. So if you could just...leave                me a little window. You know, my, uh, my aunt had a thing removed                with a laser. All right, I don't want to interrupt your meal, so...  That's gotta hurt!  It's...gotta hurt! Hurt! Because...Aaarrrrrgh!  Damn you, laser guy! You had to grab it all with your lowbrow                laser shtick! You're just a prop comic! Where's the craft?!  All right. At last, we're finally gettin' out of here.  It's probably chocolate.  All right, stop it! Stay away from my breasts! Chest!  Don't look around. Don't look around. That's what he wants.  This thing can't hurt me, can it? I mean, it is a laser.                What if it hits my eye?  I can't be blind, Jerry The blind are courageous.  Oh, my god.   They're for protection, Jerry. Can you tell where I'm lookin'?  No.  Bring it on, baby   The side?  All right!  Wait a second. I think I see where that laser guy is. No!                Don't look! Don't look. Oh, yeah, that's him. Ok. I'm gonna sneak                up on him. Now the hunted becomes the hunter.  That wasn't a laser pen.  Oh, that's funny   Well, this is a lovely apartment. Lovely! My kids are gonna                go crazy. I, uh, I wonder if I could see the bathrooms. Preferably                one with some paint thinner and, uh, some rags?  Art.  Pennypacker. Varnsen.  Jerry, the Mets lost.  How do you suppose they did that?  Yeah,                I better grab some too.  You sure?  My code?  No. No                way.

And on your dates.   Well, at the Yankees it was all about smoothing things over,          you know, chiseling away, grinding down. In fact we used to call it 'the          grind'.   That should be 14, let me just...[corrects it with a pen.]   You won't regret this, sir.   Summer of '89 I'm at the beach. This family sits up next to me.          I go in to the surfs and when I come from out, my clothes, my towel, my          umbrella, they're all gone. I am furious, I start screaming to these kids          demanding my stuff back and finally I lose it; I grab their boom box and          I chuck it in to the ocean.   Then I see my clothes floating out there. The tied took them          out, not the kids.   So now, the father is screaming at me, he's demanding that I          pay for the boom box. Finally, I gave them a fake address and got the          hell out of there.   Until that stupid photo jogs his memory.   Yeah.   It is a horrible company. There's no management what so ever.          I could go hog wild in there.   Like retouched.   Oh, this is good. This Kruger guy is clueless. I can't wait to          work for him.   What did you do here? You took out the wrong guy.   Well, I'm still here. You took out the other guy!   I am aware!   I just pray Kruger doesn't realize that it's gone until this          guy can fix it up.   When are you going on your next date with her?   What, you're gonna pass up a wonderful opportunity to put that          aloe pusher in her place?   This good be so sweet, Jerry. Saving lives? She's one step away          working at the clinique counter!   Of course not! Wash it, dry it, move on!   No no no no no, this has to be carefully orchestrated. You go          to a fancy dinner, flowers...   Yeah, you gotta do it classy [wipes his mouth to his sweater.]          Almost. Couldn't get the girl go out with me the second time.          What is this? This is a drawing.   This is a cartoon!   But it's not a photograph, I need a photograph!   I know. The only way to fix it now, is to get a whole new photo          of Kruger.   Without his shirt on.   It seemed so disorganized.   What about the Coast Guard? Seems like a lot of pride there,          a lot of tradition.   I think.   Maybe I could be a land guy.   Someone's have to unhook the boat before it leaves...the place!          I forgot to ask you; how did the revenge date go?   Did you dressed nice, did you do it classy?   Yeah you did, you classed it up!   Oh, so it backfired?   So, I guess I was lucky that I never tried that myself.   Wait a minute, she did a skin cancer screening at Peterman?   Could she do that at Kruger?   So I set up a screening, everyone takes their shirt off and click,          I snap me a shot of a bear-chested Kruger.   Jerry, you gotta talk to Sitarides.   And that was wrong, Jerry! You simple must to apologize..   Yes! Because it is the mature, adult thing to do.   I just talked to Mr. Kruger, he'll be down in a minute. He wanted          me to take a photograph for the record.   His personal file, I, I don't ask...   Jerry, what are you doing...   Dr. Sitarides don't go! Oh, thanks Jerry!   Aah, yeah, yeah. Won't you head on in, we'll be in in a second.          Be right with you.   Kramer, this is perfect. I need you to go in there, pretend you're          a doctor and check this guy for moles.   And get a picture of him, with his shirt off.   Alright, lets get in there. Quick, quick, quick...   Kramer, I really owe you one.   What?   So, tell him you're concerned about it and he should see someone          else.   Because, you're not a dermatologist.   Whoa, whoa, a section?!   No, you're not taking a deli slicer to my boss...   No! Absolutely Not!   Yep, and the photo was all fixed and back on his desk, no thanks          to you.   Why don't you see someone about it?   You're not a doctor. You shouldn't even have books like this.          You can't tell him the truth, you're gonna blow the whole thing.          I'll get him to see a real doctor. You just stay away from this.          Eh, listen Mr. Kruger, I got a message from Dr. Van Nostrand          and he says it might be wise to you to see another doctor about that mole.          Well, he said it could be cancer, maybe you should get it checked          out.   Whatever.   Well, that pear shaped loser was me! And I was in that photo,          until I broke in here, stole the photograph and airbrushed myself out          of there!   That's what they tell me!   He said he didn't care. Oh, God I love that place. Hey, have          you seen other dermatologist?   What did he give you for it.   Have to give him time on this hour.   (on phone) Jerry, it's George. Hey, hey are you all set                foe the week end.   Well how could you just play your message in front of anybody?  Well, I didn't think anyone would play it.  What do you mean not goin'? We got plans here. Call her                up.  Well maybe you should ask Elaine.   Oh no no, don't say anything to Kramer. Susan can't stand                him. He vomited all over her.   Gee, that's too bad.   Well, they got any golf courses up there?   That's pie country.  They do a lot of baking up there.  A bubble boy?   Boy!  What kind of plastic do you think it is? What do you think                like that dry cleaning plastic?  All right, beautiful, so you stop in. Ya, ya visit the                bubble boy for twenty minutes and then we can go.  All right there you go. It's a '47 cabin all right. So,                we'll see you tomorrow.  and JERRY: Very nice, very nice, nice.  and JERRY: Yeah,   Nothing, uh lets get going. Come on.  No, no, we'll talk about it later.  Would you stop that please. Would you just stop that?   ... just sit in your seat over there you're distracting                me. We're making incredible time here.   It's not my fault. Seinfeld can't drive. How hard is it                to follow somebody?   It's fine, we'll just meet him at the bubble boy's house.                I don't know of this is the house. I don't see Jerry's                car anywhere.   Stop, would you quit it.  Maybe someone is going to see us here.  Hey, I am not a prude sweetheart. I swing with the best                of them.   What?  I can't go in there. I can't face the bubble boy.   Susan, please... <grabs her>  Would you wai,..  and SUSAN: <nod>   Can you uh, go in the bubble?  So then he makes his own bed?  Uh, well, you know,...  Hi.  'Course I have. Come on. My cousin's in a bubble. My friend                Jeffrey's uh, sister, also ... you know ...bubble. I got a lot of                bubble experience. Come on.  She works for NBC.   Well, you know we gotta been running because of the ...  Humph, no, uh, it's just that ...  All right BB. Let's just play... Who invaded Spain in the                8th century?  Oh, Noooo, I'm so sorry. It's the MOOPS. The correct answer                is, The MOOPS.   I'm sorry the card says MOOPS.   It's MOOPS.   MOOPS,   Help, someone. <BUBBLE BOY is strangling George>  Jerry, what happened to you?   I was not. The BUBBLE BOY was trying to kill me. Susan                tell him.  Oh, you lying little snot. And he's a cheater. Aren't ya'                you little twerp?   MOOPS  Go, go, get out, ...  Must be a big one.  yeah, <cough> Definite smoke.  I just realized. Ya' never gave me back the change from                the toll.  Its George.  Yeah, right.  Give me two bucks. Ill do it for two bucks.  Theres no way I touch that bag for less than two dollars.  Youre not getting no Drakes Coffee Cake for fifty          cents. Yae, Hey, Im all set. I got the ticket. Im going to          the Cayman Islands this Friday.  Its an incredible deal. I dont know why you dont          come with me.  No, no the full size.  You didnt say "junior".  He didnt seem too pleased.  hey, you know what? I just remembered something. I had a dream          about that guy last night. This is amazing.   I havent seen him for months.  I was doing standup comedy in Kennebunkport Maine. ??? night          club. The stage was on a cliff and the audience was throwing all the comics          off.  Ive had a lot of other paranormal stuff happen to me.  Really?  Id love to go. Make an appointment.  I just got fired.  Its Martine. I think hes dying. He tried to kill          himself with pills.  I knew it. I always felt different.   Drakes?   Did you buy this for me?  Ha, because I love Drakes Coffee Cake.  She hasnt eaten in two days.  Pauline? . . . Wait a minute. I got it. My brother once impregnated          a woman named Pauline.  When I hear her name mentioned.  There was a woman, Audrey. She had a very big nose.  Yes, yes, she had a nose job. I loved her very deeply. Will she          ever speak to me again?  Elaine.  Ah oh? What? What Ah oh?  You can see the Cayman Islands in there? Is something going to          happen to me? What?  Elaine, shes a psychic. She knows how the kids going          to be.   Should I not go on this trip?  Elaine, what are you doing?  If you dont say anything I will assume its a plane          crash.  Not a plane crash. [leaving] Is it a plane crash?  People smoke, Elaine. My mother smoked. It didnt hurt me.  Could there be a native p0roblem in the Caymans? Maybe theres          native unrest.  How come?  Would you buy my Cayman Island ticket?  No.  The psychic said something terrible will happen.  sweetheart, no come here,  sweetheart  how did I know you were here? Something drew me here. This is          phenomenal.   Oh, thats great. Thats great. By the way I have to          apologize for my friend the other day. Friend? Uh, uh I dont even          know that woman. I met her on the bus on the way over. I couldnt          get rid of her. Uh, My psychic instincts were a little off ..  I dont know where the nurse is. Sweetheart why dont          you get a nurse for mommy?  Anyway I was just curious. Remember          the other day you were saying something about my trip.   Yeah, why? Why?   Because? Because?  Are there terrorists on the plane? A hotel fire. Is that it?          Malaria? Yellow fever? Lupus? Is it Lupus?  I never assisted in a birth before. Its really quite disgusting.          You wouldnt believe it. Rasputin.  Hey.  when did you get back?  So how was it?  Yeah, you gotta watch for the jellyfish.  Elle McPherson going to be there?  You met her at the supermarket? How did you do that?  So when're you gonna see her?  What's her name?  How could you not know her name?  Oh my God, I forgot to tell you. I got a letter today from                the   You remember the, the little bank book, there?  Alright, so I haven't put anything in it since sixth grade,                I   Yeah, interest.

I want to *parlay* it.                I wanna  What's with the gloves?  What, the whole apartment?  Yeah.  No, I saw "Home Alone II".  Well I was lost, I never saw the first one. By the way,                do you   Yeah. The *original*.  Hi...  No...  The old man got to me.  Shut up! What are you doing back so soon, anyway?  How's the guy?  That's nerve...  Y'know what it is? It's "Clara Nightingale Syndrome".                He falls   What'd I say? Clara?  Clara Barton? What did she do?  Susan B. Anthony I think I'd have a problem with.  So, you gonna buy his art?  Yeah, that's what I want-- triangles. Alright, I'm outta                here.   Y'know, now you gotta ask her her name. It's so embarrassing.  Yeah? How?  Now let's try "breast"... Celeste... Kest...                Rest... Sest... Hest...  What, you should've just asked her.  What're you gonna do now?  Aretha!  Bovary!  Alright, well you know what you gotta do, you gotta go                through her  When she goes to the bathroom.  What kind of operation is it?  Isn't that where they remove the--  Mulva!  What do you mean "into the patient"?  Into the hole?  Didn't they notice it?  How could they not notice it?!?  What did they do?  They *left* the Junior Mint *in* him?  I guess it can't hurt him... People eat *pounds* of those                things.  It's that bleak?  Y'know if the guy dies, the art could really be worth something...  Hey Elaine? Put me down for some of that art. 1 900 dollars                worth.  Hi, I'm George.  I gave it a shot... So, any word on the "artiste"?  Well, I got my triangles.  Yup, y'know, they really spruce up the apartment.  No, Jerry. I wouldn't do that.  You could get in trouble.  Who are you to play God!? Every man's time comes! If his                number   What? What?  He didn't get better, did he?  Where's the luck? There's no luck. 1 900 dollars down the                drain.  Oh, that's great. That's great.  Yes I look forward to many years of looking at the triangles.                And this is the first you're seeing of the coat?  An apartment-warming gift? We got to give presents to people                for moving? Birthdays, Christmas, it's enough gifts. I would like                one month off.  All right, but we're not buyin' it at Bloomingdale's. I                will buy it, you pay me back later. I'll sniff out a deal. I have                a sixth sense.  Hey, look at this. This is the same massage chair we're                gettin' for Joe Mayo, $60 cheaper.  I'll have 'em overnight it.  It doesn't matter if it's more comfortable. It's wrong.  Because important things go in a case. You got a skull                for your brain, a plastic sleeve for your comb, and a wallet for                your money.  I need everything in there.  I might go there.  All right, just gimme that. And gimme some of those Sweet                & Lows.  A man carries a wallet.  Love to.  No, I don't have it yet.  No, I brought a picture of the chair.  I thought we'd all sign the picture.  (answering the phone while walking away) Joe Mayo's apartment?  And you threw it out the window?  God, you're like a rock star.  Well, I'm satisfied. Uh...my back is...killing me.  This...is an organizer, a secretary, and a friend.  Here, just give me a couple of napkins.  There, there I'm fine.  I think I had some hard candy in there.  No, no, this is supposed to go to Joe Mayo's apartment.  Ahhh. How does this thing work?  Ahhhhh...  Yeah?  Not yet. Oh! Ho ho! God...  It's in... transit.  Allllll right!  Hey.  It gets here when it gets here. Would you stop ridin' me?  Excuse me?  Oh, I can't believe you're dropping out, too. So now Kramer                and I have to pay for the entire gift?  He's the guy we're the buying the chair for, remember?                It was your suggestion.  Oh, so now I have to buy this whole chair by myself?  I already bought it! I've been lyin' to you for three days,                and now you're all screwin' me!  I needed it! My back is... a little tweaked.  Never! It is a part of me. I will just return the chair,                and it will be easy, because the receipt is in my good friend.  Well, at least, I'm not carrying a purse.  Learn guitar, first lesson free? Huh.  My receipts! The chair! My tiger poster!  Why is there no haggling in this country?  Not me. Everything should be negotiable.  Absolutely. You're telling me there's no room to move on                pasta.   Excuse me, how much is this?  I'll give you a quarter.  Thirty.  Alright see? We got something there.   I still don't understand how you can call lunch with me                a business   It stinks.   Hey, you like?  Really? Elaine...Peterman account?  Hey.  This hat just bottles in the heat, I don't even need a                coat! It's   And I got a date with the sales woman. She's got a little                Marisa   I'm going out with her tomorrow, she said she had some                errands to run.  What's the difference? You know they way I work, I'm like                a  If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind keys, glove,                scarf, I go   Oh no I'm in already come on.   So you want to get together tomorrow?  What about this weekend?  OK, see ya!  What, those aren't my keys.   Oh, they are my keys, how weird.  Yea.   Costanza. [Like "By Mennen"]  I left it at Heather's. Are these alive?  Alright, alright ,I'll call Heather, you'll get your hat                back, I will   Heather Hi, it's George Costanza.   Ah , listen. I don't mean to bother you but, silly me,                I think I may   I'm pretty sure I left it behind the cushion of the chair                ...  You know maybe ... I'll ...   Well not really...  Well that makes sense.  Good to see you again.   She's bluffing, she's got it stashed away in there somewhere.                Oh, I don't know. Check this out.   Yep, this one for our side!   Yea, but get this, the message said 'call me if you have                the time'.  She knows that I have her clock, I know that she has my                hat, I think   I've looked at that, seems unlikely.   I can't talk to Jerry anymore, even since he moved into                that   So how do you want to do this?  So you really don't have my hat?  Oh. let's go do something.  That's a sandwich.   Damn salami.   That damn deli that is last time they screw up one of my                orders.   Fantastic day! Fantastic!   Well, first, I'm brushing my teeth and this piece of apple-skin,          that must have been lodged in there for days, comes loose.  Then, I'm at The Foundation...  Sometimes, once in a while.  No, occasionally I'll forget to let the machine pick up. Anyway,          they made this large donation to a women's prison, and I get to go down          there and check it out.  Yeah-hah!  Nothing really, you know...just stroll around the cell blocks,          maybe take in a shower fight. (chuckles.) Hey, you know you got a bounced          check hanging up in the little market over on Columbus?  I noticed you chose the "clowns with balloons" check          design.  Listen, sweetheart, let me tell you a little something about          guts. <Points to his head.>   These are not "scraps." These are historic remains          of a once great society of hair.  Tennis courts? What about the yard? Where do they have the gang          fights?  Hmm. What about a hole? You ever put anybody in "the box"?  Thanks, Warden.  Well, let's just say it wouldn't exist without me. <Notices          another person in the library dressed the same as Celia.> So uh, you          two shop at the same store?  Oh my God...you're in jail? <Celia nods.> That is so cool!  Well...not "out." She's in prison.  Why not?  That was different!   Jerry, I like being with her. Plus, I know where she is all the          time. I have relatively no competition. And you know how you live in fear          of the pop-in?  Yeah, no pop-in, no "in the neighborhood," no "I          saw your light was on." And the best part is, if things go really          well...  Embezzlement.  Allow me. Why?  Yeah. I had a great time.  The whole hour just flew by. <Begins cleaning up the table.>  Oh, thanks, Bobby. (To Celia) Well, I guess I'll see you in four          days.  Of course you will. You're the best.  How're the folks?  So? Movie tonight?  I did. I'm back. I love this relationship, I feel so liberated!  The only thing that bothers me is that I'm just coming up with          this now.  That's like using a wheelchair for the fun of it!  Hey, I brought you some cigarettes. You buy yourself something          nice.  Parole! <Feigning joy> That's dynamite!  Celia's up for parole.  What?  She's been locked up for two years. She's gonna want to make          up for lost time. Dinners. Movies. <Rubs his forehead.> Talking...  And that's no good. I've tried it straight, Jerry. We've all          seen the results. For me, sick is the only way to go.  It's not the same.   Well, anything I can do to help, um...she's a wonderful girl.          Very smart. Very...crafty.   Plans. Schemes. She keeps talking about getting back together          with her old friends - "the gang," as she likes to call them,          you know. Yeah, they're hatching something, you can count on that.   No, no, Kurt - wrong attitude. You should be happy now.   You've still got pretty good coverage. Once the enemy advances          beyond this perimeter - <points at Kurt's head with a pen> - then          you won't be Kurt anymore.  Yes. Live, dammit. Live! Every precious moment as if this was          the last year of your life. Because in many ways...it is. <There's          a knock at the door.> Excuse me.  Celia? What are you doing here?  Is that good?  Celia broke out of prison. I'm sitting in my home, she shows          up at the door!  Yeah. Hey Jerry, listen to this. I discovered something even          better than conjugal visit sex. Fugitive sex! Now, it's like everytime          -  Hey, sorry I'm late.   She didn't want to come, she's not really into sports. <Kramer          comes over with Little Jerry.>  Where's the tamale guy? <The bell rings, and the cockfight          begins.>  When are they gonna have the flying cars, already?  Years. When we were kids, they made it seem like it was                right around the corner.  No. That's just electric.  (Sarcastic) What's the competition, Chitty Chitty Bang                Bang?  The government is very touchy about us being in the air.                Let us run around on the ground as much as we want. Anything in                the air is a big production.   And the underwater bubble cities?   What is wrong with you? You never tell 'em you like the                car. (Advising) You're not sure what you want. You don't even know                why you're here.   I'm starving. We should have had lunch first..   Since when is Elaine's boyfriend selling cars? I thought                he was a mechanic.   That's an easy move: go from screwin' you behind your back                to screwin' you right to your face.   Puddys just gonna give you the car, huh? (Skeptic)                Youll see. First they stick you with the undercoating, rust-proofing,                dealer prep. Sudeenly, youre  My father had a car salesman buddy. He was gonna fix him                up real nice. Next thing I know, Im gettin dropped of                in a Le Car with a fabric sunroof. All  Look at these salesmen. The only thing these guys fear                is the walk-out. No matter what they say, you say, "Ill                walk out of here right now!"   (Threatening) Hold it! One more step and were walkin!                (Still with a tone) He is. You dont know what Im                doin here.   (Mocking, skeptic) Yeah, you show us the 900.   Im starving. You got any of those free donuts you                use to soften people up?   (Getting up, he addresses Jerry) Alright, remember: no                rust-proofing. Commit to nothing. If you have to speak - mumble.                Dont think it cant happen! (Leaves)   Hey, hey, hey! Whats goin on here? (To Jerry)                You didnt agree to anything, did ya?   (Aggravated) Well, I got screwed on the donuts. There were                none left.   (To Jerry) Hey, gimme a dollar.   (Talking it) Im here helpin you.  (On his way out) Heh, heh, heh. Thats what they want                you to think.   Twix.. (Makes various noises) B-5.   Ah, come on!   Ah, excuse me. Do you have change of a dollar?   Could I, uh, could I trade you for another dollar?   (Stopping him) Excuse me. When your, uh, when your wallet                was open, I glanced inside, and I couldnt help but notice                that you had several crisp dollar  (Persistent) Perhaps you could look again, please? Im                very hungry.   (Losing it) I guess everyone here enjoys giving the old                screwgie, huh?! Youre all doin a hell of a job! (Looks                longingly at the Twix in the machine) Ho,  People can drop change down here, Jerry. And theyre                too lazy to pick it up.   The cashier is at lunch - which is where Id like                to be.   (Looking at his finger) I think somethin bit me.                I just need another nickel.   Ho, ho, ho! Hes got a live one. Hes just reeling                his big fish in!   (Stingy) Its wrinkled. Its worthless.   (As the Twix starts to move) Ha, ha, ha, ha! (The Twix                gets stuck in the spindle right before falling. George begins to                pound the machine) Come on!  They did?   As you will see, the candy bar is paid for, and yet, remains                dangling in the machine. (Notices that the Twix slot is completely                empty) Hey, its gone.  Uh, it was dangling! There were only two left in the machine!                He mustve bought one, and gotten both.   No! (The salesman walks away. He addresses the mechanic                through the doors window) Hey! Hey! I can see you! That is                my Twix! (The mechanic eats  Excuse me. I believe you just ate my Twix bar. It was dangling.                And when you purchased your Twix bar, you got a little freebie,                and you never bothered  Huh. You must think Im pretty stupid. That was no                5th Avenue bar. I can see the crumb right there in the corner of                your lip! Now, that-that-that is a  Nougat? Please. I think Ive reached the point in                my life where I can tell between nougat and cookie. So, lets                not just say things that are obvious  (Watching the mechanic leave) I know about the vein! I                cant believe this guy..   Hey, starving! (Grabs the box from Jerry)   I tried to tell you, but you wouldnt listen. No,                ho, ho! You were gonna get a deal, huh? Theres now laws in                this place. Anything goes! Its  Stay back!   Alright, Puddy, listen, and listen good: I need to know                the name of that mechanic that walks around here. Big guy, a liar.                Short name. Sam? Moe? Sol?!   Im starving! I can feel my stomach sucking up against                my spine.   (Standing up) Yes. This is wrong!   Just because a candy bar fails to fall from its perch..!                (Losing it) ..does not imply transfer of ownership. Moe,                Sol, or Lem is not gonna get away with this!   Id like to report a problem with one of your mechanics.                (To the man behind him in line) Yeah right.. Im gonna                get my car repaired at a dealership. Huh! Why dont I just                flush my money down the toilet?   One of your guys - Kip, or Ned, short name - stole my Twix                candy bar!   He might as well have! I caught him, and his face was covered                in chocolate and cookie crumbs.   Oh, it was. But he claimed it was a 5th Avenue bar.   Oh, no, no. Twix is the only candy with the cookie crunch.                No. Rice and caramel.   No.   Please.   All I want is my seventy-five cents back, an apology, and                for him to be fired!  They all have swirling chocolate in the commercial!   Alright! Do you mind? I have the window! (To Willie) Now,                what are you gonna do about my Twix?   No! Theres no coconut!   Now, if this mechanic guy, was, in fact, eating a 5th Avenue                bar, as he claimed, wouldnt you agree he would have no problem                picking one out from a  Ive spent the last hour preparing ten candy bars                with no wrappers of identification of any kind for him to select                from.   Only I hold the answer key to their true candy identities.                And so, without further ado, I give you.. the candy line-up. (Opens                a door to a back room.  Thats my candy line-up! Where are all my cards?!                Theyre - theyre all on the floor!   And you! How many Twix does that make for you, today?!                Like, 8 Twix?!   Its a Twix! Theyre all Twix! It was a setup!                A setup, I tell ya! And youve robbed it! Youve all screwed                me again! Now, gimme one! Gimme a Twix!   (Yelling out, frustrated. The camera spins from a top angle)                Ttttttwwwwiiiiiixxxxx!   (Munching on a hamburger) This Arbys is good.   (In the spotlight) I dont know. All of em.                Theyre all crooks! Besides, I couldnt get all different                candy bars, anyway.   What was that?   Can I say one word to you? Lobster. The lobster here is                Yes, well, you know, Im not thinking about the price.                You know   We do?  Why?  Um, you know Im starting to think that maybe lobster                isnt the way   Its over.  Kramer.  Lobster.  She says we cant go out anymore.  Because Im not Latvian Orthodox. Her parents wont                let her get   I know. This was the only woman I never lied to. Well thats                not   She knew I didnt have a job, she knew I lived at                home. Didnt seem   I cant. I met them. Theyre devout. You know,                In the cab on the   Why not? What do I care?  Really?  King Edward. King Edward, Jerry.  You know what? I could probably do this. Whats the                difference.  No. I wouldnt even have to tell her. I could surprise                her.  How hard could it be? You make a little contribution, have                a   *ahem* In this age of uncertainty and confusion, a man                begins to ask   No.  No not vast (he pronounces it as "vost")  Yes.

You know the uh flood, and the uh lepers, and                the   Oh yes I am Father. Incredibly sincere. So, uh, pffft,                am I in?  Ah hah. You see Father, Im Im incredibly anxious                to become a   Nice nun.  I cant believe how easy it is. Im virtually                Orthodox. All I have   Thats all there is to it. By Christmas day I will                be Brother   Brother Costanza will be taking the vow of silence.  Kramer, they like everybody. Theyre friendly people.  Story.  She likes you.  So?  Well how do you even know its hers? Maybe it belonged                to Carol.   Well take a look. It might not even belong to her.  People always leave old things in their medicine cabinet.  I still have brill cream.  What? Nothing.  Im fine.  Nothing.  No.  No!  I dont know. I cant believe theyre making                me take this test.  What does it look like Im doing?  Oh, Im Im full of it Father.  Oh, I understand.  For a woman.  No its a regular religion.  I dont want to get out of it.  No no.  Yes faddah.  What?  I said faddah, I meant Father. Just a little bit nervous.  Well I didnt do it for my mother.  Latvia?  Enjoy, enjoy.  Id like a doggie bag for this please.  (bursting out of the bathroom, fumbling with his fly) Button                fly!  (incredulous) What?  Nothing.  I dont get art.  Well, it always has to be explained to me, and then I have                to have  What for?  So do I, but I wouldn't hang it on a wall.  You know, I'm a little nervous.  Well, you know... the friend meeting the new woman. I feel                like I'm  Really? I thought you liked her.  You know, it's a miracle you're not married. (beat) Hey,                I'm not  (looking uncomfortable) Um... yeah! Sure, sure I'm interested.  (gritting teeth) Yeah, sure.  I am an art-adorer! I adore art.  Behind the dugout, are you kidding? How did you get them?  All my life I've dreamed of sitting front row, behind the                dugout!  Look at where we are! (referring to the seat usher) He's                not  She said first row! Right behind the dugout!  I was all primed for the first row; I was gonna put my                feet up  Oh, there's better, (pointing at the row in front of them)                right  (amused) You're supposed to do that?  I'd rather go to a hanging.  Yeah?  Hi! Mr. West, this is my friend Elaine--  --and this is Kramer.  Okay.  Yeah, it's being framed right now. I don't even know what                it costs.  Just take the cap off.  Just take the cap off!  (to Elaine) Do you want us to go with you?  Okay, we'll go!  Five-hundred dollars?! What?  I'm not paying $500 for this! It's a piece of junk!  Why did you even take it? You broke up with her!  You weren't thinking.  Well, I'm not buying it. No way. Forget it. No way I'm                buying this!  I'm not paying for this. If you were going out with her,                it'd be a  Hey, Kramer.  What?  What's it say?  WOW!  (on intercom) It's George.  Hey, Nina! (beat) I owe you some money, don't I?  Oh, yeah, me too, me too. Boy oh boy oh boy...! You know,                in fact,   This could be in a museum some day! It's not safe with                me! It should  Who said anything about money? (intercom buzzes)  I just popped in now. I'm a big pop-in guy.  How 'bout Kramer.  (as Jerry and Elaine continue to whine) Give it! Give it!                (he finally  This is incredible!  Maybe I won't send her that check.  Five-thousand? Why would anybody buy Kramer for $5000?                (laughs)  So is it all over between you and... Marsha Mason?  Tell you what, I'll make a deal with you. I'll sell it                to you right  Behind the dugout, that's where we were sitting the other                day.  Yeah. No problem.  Woah, I gotta watch this guy's bag.  I'm sure he'll be back in a second.  Excuse me sir. Would you mind watching my bag for a minute?  Where are you going?  Yeah. I did some shopping. Some new clothes shopping. (turns                to a man) Can I borrow your menu?  The guy never came back.  I'm still watching them.  All right, let me ask you something: When do you start                to worry about ear hair?  It's like puberty that never stops. Ear puberty, nose puberty,                knuckle puberty, you gotta be vigilent. Let me ask you this: Do                you know where Walker Street is downtown? I've got a league meeting                there.  I love it. New office, new salary. I'm the new Wilhelm.  They got a new intern from Francis Louis High. His name                is Keith. He comes in Mondays after school.  Where are you meeting these women? When they get off the                bus at the port authority?  Thanks. Thanks a lot.  Well actually I'm...  Little Rock, Arkensas.  It's beautiful. She makes all the plans. I'm not from around                here so it's okay if I'm stupid, and she knows I'm only in town                visiting so there's no messy breakup  I got a hotel room.  Well I don't know anyone here Jerry. Where else am I going                to stay?  So?  Oh really. You tell her you shaved it?  Reality tour?  Yeah my parents have it. Sometimes it skips a generation.  Willie. Yeah.  Well what if I told you I'm thinking of moving here?  Eat me alive, huh? We'll see who can make it in *this*                town.  Find a job. Get an apartment.  Never mind. The're done. All I have to do now is redo them.                You know if you take everything I've ever done in my entire life                and condense it down into one day, it looks decent.  What's desert?  He eats those?  I think I understand this. Jay Peterman is real. His biography                is not. Now, you Kramer are real.   But your life is Peterman's. Now the bus tour, which is                real, takes to places that, while they are real, they are not real                in sense that they did not *really* happen to the *real* Peterman                which is you.  $2300.  Yeah.  Yeah, well I uh got lots of other stuff to show you too.                Wait till you see the plum job that I landed.  Yes. Very nice to have had her to mention... (starting                to leave)  Be right with you. Look Mr. Steinbrenner.  Dogs, twists, a kind of fermented chicken drink.  What clothes?  (talking on the phone) Jerry you gotta bring me some clothes                down here. I lost my job with the Yankees. I'm standing in the men's                room on 43rd street in my underpants.  Yeah. What are you doing with the Daily Worker?  Your boyfriend reads the Daily Worker? What is he? A   Maybe he's just "very well RED"?  Well, does he wear bland, drab, olive colored clothing?  Huh, he's a communist. . . . Look at this. "Exciting   I can't believe you're really going out with a woman named   Duncan Meyers?   I looked up. I couldn't believe it.  So you lied to her?  Hey, did I tell you I called one of those girls from the personal          ads in The Daily Worker?  And they say appearance is not important.  What's up?  He wants to meet you? I'll tell you what. I'll show up. He doesn't          know we're friends. I'll pretend I haven't seen you since High School.          I'll back up the story.  Not bad? It's gorgeous!  Natalie?  Thank you.   Hello, it's Natalie? Yeah, this is a business office but I'm          not a business man per se. I'm here working for the people. Yes, I'm causing          dissent. Stirring the pot. Getting people to question the whole rotten          system.  Oh, my God, No, oh my God, . . . Jerry!  George, George Costanza!  Yes yes yes This is unbelievable.  Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, don't tell me, don't tell me.          It starts with a . . . Duncan Meyers. Oh, wow, this is something. I haven't          seen you guys in what, twenty years?   So what have you been doing with yourself?  Ah ha, well, I really wouldn't know about that. I don't watch          much TV. I like to read. So what do you do, a lot of that "did you          ever notice?" this kind of stuff.  It strikes me a lot of guys are doing that kind of humor now.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. Well, I guess I started losing it when I was about          twenty-eight right around the time I made my first million. You know what          they say. The first million is the hardest one.  I'm an architect.  Have you seen the new addition to the Guggenheim?   Yep. And it didn't take very long either.  Well, well, I had a dream, Jerry.   Well, I like to stay in touch with the people.  You know my driver's waiting, I really should get running. Good          to see you guys again.  Ha, uh,   Oh, the big race.  Yes, yes,.  Yes, sure, surely was. Yeah, I'll remember that day. Well I'll          never forget it because that was the day that I uh, lost my virginity          to Miss. Stafford, the uh, voluptuous home room teacher.  Yes, yes, you know I was in detention and she came up behind          me while I was erasing the blackboard . . .   But I digress. Let me see, now. You were standing at one end          of the line and I was right next to you. And I remember we were even for          like, the first five yards and then , BOOM,...You were gone.   Head start, oh no absolutely not.  (on phone) . It's George Costanza. . are there any messages for          me? Why does Mr. Steinbrenner want to see me in his office? . . . Communist?          I'm not a Communist . . . . All right, all right. All right, I'll be there.          - ( hangs up ) My secretary Ada, told Mr Steinbrenner I'm a Communist          Now he wants to see me   You, uh, wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?  C-Communist? I am a Yankee, sir, first and foremost.  Sir?  Yes, sir. Yes sir, do my best.  Okay, all right, all right.  You wanted to see me, El Presidente?  Si, si.  Muy sumpatico. Muy muy muy.  Oh, oh!  Oh well, gracias El Commandante, gracias. Muy muy.  Jerry,   I think I saw him. I think it's him.  Did you see the homeless guy on the library steps screaming                obsenities and doing some   I think that's Mr. Hayman. ...The gym teacher from our                High School.  He's older, completely covered in filth, no whistle, but                I think it's him.  <yells> I didn't tattle   There was an incident. I'd rather not discuss it.  Some other time.  Let's see if it's Hayman?  I don't understand lunch, I don't know anything about lunch.                Listen. Just because   He purposely mispronounced my name. Instead of saying,                "Costanza" He'd say,   OK, OK, I never even had him for gym.  Little baked beans  Well, OK. As I said the guy had it in for me. He actually                failed me in gym.   ... Those spastic shnitzer twins ...   Yes, Mr. Hayman  Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.  I'm not really sure, I...  He gave me a wedgie.  Because the underwear is pulled up from the back and ...                it wedges in..  Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it  It's George  Well, it's definetly him.   Him who? Hayman him.  Oh, I found him. He was sitting on the steps of the library.                I sat down   So I said, "Mr. Hayman, It's me george Costanza, JFK,                ... " He doesn't move.   It was.  How should I know?  Me?  The locker room!  Jerry, it's me, George, don't worry, I'll return it tomorrow,                no problem.  Yes Mr. Hayman.  Well I guess that's because I wear boxer shorts.  I'm not really sure, I...  Na, he's gone. I wonder what happened to him.   ...pianist. A *classical* pianist. She *plays* the piano.                She's a   We did a crossword puzzle together, *in bed*. It was the                most fun   I was telling you about Noel.  [sarcastically] Heh heh heh... So side-splittingly funny...  What, you think I'm going to repeat the whole thing now?  No everything is *not* going good. I'm very uncomfortable.                I have   How do I get the hand?  She's playing a recital this week at the McBierney School.                You wanna hear her play? I got two extra tickets, you and Elaine                could go...  Then afterwards maybe we could all go out together. Y'know                she'll  With all due respect, I don't think so...  What, did you go swimmin'? It's 29 degrees out!  What the Hell is a "Polar Bear"?  Hey, what goes on there, exactly?  No, I-I-I know... [retreats back to his Chinese take out]                I know...  *No*...  All right, I think they have fleas there. So what...  I told her we'd all go out afterwards, okay? And don't                applaud   What did you put the Pez dispenser on her leg for in the                first   What kind of a sick impulse does that??  What are we gonna tell her?  No, don't say a word. If she thinks my friends are jerks,                then   Hey, hey! We're discussing something!  What are you? A *baby*!? All right. Tell her.  Uh, can we cut to the chase?  Yeah...  A lot of people say it.  [Accusingly] What's *that*?  [Realizing full well it isn't] ...Yes it is.  Y'know people, we got a situation over here!  All right, OK, I'm goin' in.  Hi, hi, hi, You were wonderful.  Oh, these are my friends, Elaine and Jerry, ... Noel  Me, uh, uh, no, ...  If she want's to continue to have a fibre of her being                she'll be very careful (hitting each other)  All right, so are you ready, so we'll go out and get something                to eat.  We'll have a good time  Ah, come on  Um, all right, um, uh, I'll call 'ya. I'll call you and                we'll talk on the phone. A telephone communiqu. Every thing is                fine ok, uh, fine, .. [exits]  It's George  Well it's over. It's definitely over.   No, but I can tell she's going to. I can sense it. We had                this terrible phone conversation.   Let's see, How I'm very good at going in reverse in my                car, why isn't Postum a more popular drink,   Anyway there was all this tension. I asked her if she wanted                to go out to dinner and she said   Lunch is fine at the beginning then you move on to dinner.                you don't move back to lunch. It's like being demoted.   I have no power Do you understand? I need hand. I have                no hand.  What?  A preemptive breakup. This is an incredible idea. I got                nothing to lose.   So, I am have to going to break up with you.  I, ... am breaking up with, ... you.  Shocked?  Never expected this did you?  Well, live and learn.  Kind of.  Well, I didn't mean to hurt you kid.  Now, stop it ...  When you're playing the piano do you think about me?  This is what I'm talking about.  All the time.  I can't hear you.  See, It's not so hard.   It's George  We just came from Chadway's(?) What's going on.  Oh, right, right, the intervention. Should we leave?  Jerry, let me tell you something, "A man without hand                is not a man."   (to Kramer) This man is a genius. Genius!  I don't think so I know so, Kramer, come here I got to                talk to you  No, I, uh, um, wa, wa, What did I do? ... Where are you                going?  You can't break up with me. I've got hand.  I can't do these puzzles.   Ah ah Pez dispenser.  Well they're hard to load.  Poor kid.  What did you do?  Wow  What's a three letter word for candy?  What does she look like?  What actress does she remind you of?  Loni Anderson?!  Yeah, sure. I was showing a condo on 48th st. Besides,                you think  Yeah, me too...  You came to see me; I work in the building.  I'm an *architect*.  I'm not?  I suppose *you* could be an architect...  Alright, she's not even gonna ask, if we *see* her, which                is remote.  We're having lunch with a friend-- he works in the building.  Bert... Har... bin... son. Bert Har-bin-son.  No good? Alright, how about Art... Corr.....   ...velay...  Yeah, right.  He's an importer.  He's an importer/exporter, okay?   Say, did Elaine ever call you back?  I don't understand, you never talk to her about other women?  I forgot who I am! Who am I?!  Vandelay!  Let me be the architect, I can do it!  Nice to meet you.  Yeah, Art *Vandelay*.  ...And exporter.  I'm, uh, I'm an architect.  Uh, railroads, uh...  They can...  I'll just, uh, get a paper...  (to              the guy next to him) This guy stinks. (speaking of Michael)  Uh,              excuse me. (stopping them from rehearsing) Excuse me. (he walks to              the guy's in charge of yelling: "take #!") This--This is not right.              May I? (the guy looks at George with a bothered face. George then              walks up to Tom and takes him away from Jerry and Michael to talk              to him in private)(to Tom) You see, you're going: "They fooled *me*              Jerry!" (George shakes his head with disapproval) You wanna hit 'fooled'              more: "They *fooled* me Jerry!". You see the difference?  Just              a suggestion. (chuckles and walks back to the yelling guy)  (very              casual and raising his hand in the air) Yep. That's five!  Why              is that?  Oh,              you're fine... you're fine. (looking at Tom in the back and then quieter              to Jerry) So you think this guy playing Kramer took the raisins?  Yeah,              it's bizarre. (they both look around them suspiciously)  Remember              when you came to audition for us?  There              was a box of raisins on the coffee table. Did you, by any chance,              take them with you when left?  Well              we were all eating the raisins. And I remember you--you were eating              some of the raisins. And then you left, and the raisins were gone.              And I was just wondering if, you know (chuckles), maybe you took them              with you.  Oh,              no, no--  No you              wouldn't. Nobody would. It's just that... they were missing, and...              well I'm just inquiring. (chuckles nervously)  Mm-hmm.              Mm-hmm. All right. I don't think we're gonna have any problem with              that. (chuckles nervously) Good talking to you Tom. Really.  The              doc called and said the lab's backed up and now I'm not gonna get              the results for another two days.  What              do you mean?  Come    What              about me? I was a total failure. Everything was fine. Now this thing's              gonna be a success and God's gonna give me a terminal disease.  The              guy playing Kramer threatened me.  'cause              I asked him about the raisins.  Oh yeah.  I don't              know.  That's              what I'm trying to find out.  Yes              it is.  This              is George Costanza, I'm calling for my test results. Negative? Oh,              my God. WHY! WHY! WHY? What? What? Negative is good? Oh, yes of course!              How stupid of me. Thank you. Thank you very much. (he hangs up)  (he              walks casually to Tom, and taps his arm) Listen. I know we've had              our problems in the past, but we got a show to do tonight. Time to              pull together as a team. Life's too short. I say, let's let bygones              be bygones. If you took the raisins, if you didn't take the raisins--              They weren't even my raisins. I was just curious because it seems              like a strange to do to walk into a room, audition, and to walk out              with a box of raisins. Anyway, whatever. If you ever want to tell              me about it, the door to my office is always opened. In the event              that I get an office. You'll come in, we'll talk about the raisins.              We'll have a nice laugh.  Sic              semper tyrannis? What is that, Latin?  Really?              What does it mean?  I can              see that.  Yeah,              me too.  You              went for the big "E".  Shh!              This is it!  You              hurt me.  Do you              really think so?  And              God didn't kill me.  It was              you!  Yes              it is! You're very charming!  Well,              well, well.  You              must be very proud Mr. Visaki. (shaking his hand) And may I say sir              they're lovely girls, absolutely lovely girls. It's nice to see such              fine upstanding women in gainful employment, Mr. Visaki.  A table              right here.  Peggy!              (they all sit) His daughter Peggy. Peggy's coming over to serve.  Ah!              Peggy. Good to see you.  Thank              you very much. (Peggy leaves the menus and walks away) So guess what              I got do tomorrow?  Start              looking for a job.  Are              you crazy?

You could swim with the dolphins                down there.  You could pet them. They come right out of the water onto                the  Rid? Nah, c'mon, the word is 'care'. Care.

(Drawing attention back                to him) Excuse me!  What? You mean with a                knife?  (Angry) Yeah, that's                what they told me the last time.  I have to have my tonsils                taken out.  Well, what should I do,                Kramer?  Holistic.. that sounds                right.  (To Jerry) Let me ask                you something.. How much do you think it would cost to have tonsils                and adenoids removed in the hospital?  Uh-huh. And how much                does the healer charge?  Oh, yeah? Holistic..                that's what I need. That's the answer.  So, how do you like the                way I talked you into comin' down here?  All I know is I've been                going to doctors all my life. What has it gotten me? I'm thirty-three                years old. I haven't outgrown the problems of puberty, I'm  Besides, what's it gonna                cost me? Thirty-eight bucks?  April.  Really?  Yes.  ..Okay.  Yes, yes I am.  (Still on the showers)                Can I use hot water on my face?  (Still on the hot water)                What about shaving?  I guess so.  (Once again, still on                the shower) Could it be lukewarm?  (Takes a sip) Hey, it's                not too bad..  (In a state of hysteria)                I'm an eggplant! I'm an eggplant! I'm a minstrel man!  My face! My face! Get                me to the hospital!  Now?! I'm a mutant!  My heart! My heart! (To                Assistant) Where you going? Are you crazy?!  You can't leave! This                is an ambulance! This is an emergency!  This'll only take a second.  [to himself] Hey, whatd'ya know? Look at that! A *lesbian*                [to himself] Oh, my God! It's Susan! What do I do?  [to himself] Argh! [to Susan] Susan! Hi! Oh, boy! What                are  Oh, ... some stupid movie...  Oh, hi...  Yes. Well...  Yeah. Yes! I just haven't seen you in a long time.  Oh, *please*! Me? C'mon! That's *great*! Are you kidding?                I   Of course you do... It's just, uh, y'know, I-I never *knew*,                uh,   There you go.  So, uh, how long has this been going on?  Ssssso, after me, you... went that way?  Oh, I think that's fantastic. Good for you. Nice. That's                very   Oh, I, uh--  It's a foreign movie... a *film*, is what it is, actually.  No, no, no... Just a *tiny* bit... It's not even *frontal*                nudity.  Oh, that's me.  Yes, good to see you, too. And Good luck with, uh... with                the  [embarrassed pause] ``Rochelle, Rochelle''.  $3.49? It says $1.49.  What! There's no signs here! This is an outrage!  I'm not giving you the satisfaction. I'm gonna watch it                again...  What is that? B.O.?  This is *unbelievable* B.O.  So, let me ask you. Do you think I could have done this?  No, no, I mean, driving Susan to lesbianism.  What if her experience with me *drove* her to it?  The woman she's "lesbianing" with? Susan told                me she's *never*   Oh, this isn't even B.O.! This is *beyond* B.O.! It's *B*.B.O.!  Y'know, the funny thing is, somehow I find her more appealing                Stinks.  Oh, it's the chicken and the egg...  Forget about smelling the car. Smell the valet. Go to the                Listen, I gotta ask you: I was a little concerned that                perhaps I   What $98.00?  How could that piece of *crap* cost $98.00!?  So, was it me?  Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. I'll pay you back.  Listen. Let me ask you something. If you and Mona were                ever   Why? That's a *legitimate* sociological question.  It's not me! It's the car!  How could it still smell after all that?  Well, what are you gonna do?  You're *selling* the car!?  Maybe I'll buy it.  He stole your girlfriend?  Amazing. I drive them to lesbianism, he brings 'em back.  I know what you're going through. Women. Who knows what                they want?  Listen. You're beautiful. You're intelligent. You'll meet                other  Yes, I know so. You happen to be a very eligible lesbian.  Hey, I know what I'm talking about. I gotta be honest with                you, I  Yeah, you're just so... hip.  Oh, my God...  It's Allison. I dated her right after you. She's obsessed                with me.  Allison! Hi! Oh, my God! How are you?  Right. I don't have it on me. Allison, this is Susan. Susan,                Did she say why?   Maybe she's diabetic.   Maybe you said something that offended her.   Like at the airport?   That's a great idea!!!   We could be zipping all over the place.   They never try anything.   No harm!   Well, I can't walk anywhere now. I just gonna be wishing there          were walkways.   Kramer, what's the name of the store with the mannequin?   Wait a minute, Rinitze? Don't they have somme really cool suits          in there?   I'm gonna go with you. I gotta get a new suit. I got a second          interview with MacKenzie, and I think I'm really close. They're all taking          me out to lunch on Friday.   All right. All right.   It's like some pod landed from another planet and took your body.          Don't fall asleep Elaine.   Whoa, look at this. This is a beautiful suit. Huh?   You think so?   You really think this looks O.K. on me?   Pfft! What can you do?   Yes, hello. Party's over.   So you think you can put the suit aside and hold it for me?   Oh yes, of course, and we have to be fair.     No, no, no, this suit is not for sale.     Look, I'm doing you a favor. They're having an unadvertised sale.          This suit is gonna be half-priced starting ... Monday.   Yes. Now take off those pants.     Why didn't you just tell her?   How could he not have washed?   Yeah, just like I do.   Well, I think Poppie's got some problems. There's a whole other          thing going on with Poppie. So how did you leave ti?   Olive?   I got to get downtown and buy that suit. The store opens in twenty          minutes.   Yeah. The last time I saw her, she was naked.     Hid? I have no idea how this suit got misplaced. Nevertheless,          I do believe I shall purchase it.   Oh, I'll pay. Half-price. Arrivederci my fellow 40-short.   You're telling me.   I probably didn't hear it on the way over because of the street          noise.   This MacKenzie, he's a bit of a nut. Someone told me he fired          the last guy because his nose whistled when he breathed.   Let's say it comes down to me and one other guy. He's got a nice          quiet suit, and I'm whooshing all over the place! Who do you think he's          gonna hire?   No, I didn't hear anything.   No, can't say as I did.   Could be the leaves...   I heard the last guy got fired because his nose whislted.   No problem there. Conformity is an obsession with me.   Oh...   No. But I was the only one at the table that didn't get violently          ill.   What happened to your itch?   Did you ever solve the riddle of the pie?   What happened to your voice?  Well, Jerry, I been thinkin'. I've gotten as far as I can                go with George Costanza.  The nickname. George. What is that? It's nothing. It's                got no snap, no zip. I need a nickname that makes people light up.  But I was thinking...T-bone.  There's no G-bone.  That's a myth.  T-bone steak.  Well, I am just a T-bone kinda guy. Love that T-bone. In                fact, you might as well call me--  Uh, no. No, we shouldn't.  Hey, it's George. Listen, I-  No. No T-bone.  'Cause Neil Watkins from accounting is T-bone!  Your girlfriend is doin' your laundry?  You're sleepin' with the maid?  I've done that. Did you ever eat an ostrich burger?  Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a second there, Watkins?  The thing is...I'm supposed to be T-bone.  What? Now, you listen to me!  Ok, everybody, uh...I have an announcement to make. From                now on, I will be known as-  What?  Koko.  Yeah. So, how's Cindy the maid?  Tell me about it. I went out with this girl last week.                First I had to pay for dinner, then--  How much you pay this maid?  40? I'm payin' 60 to my maid. She doesn't do laundry and                I'm gettin' nothin'. All right. Once she pinched my ass, but I don't                know what that was.  I can't eat with you leanin' over like this. Just look                straight forward.  What?  Never mind.  What happened to Mrs. Krantz?  I'll try a piece.  Hey.   Oh, yeah.  It's "ooh" As in "ooh ooh ah ah."   Really? Coco?  You know, if I could get this Coco woman down to Kruger,                they wouldn't be able to call me Koko anymore because Kruger would                never allow 2 Kokos.  Say good-bye to Koko.  This is our new Vice-president of Acquisitions, sir.  Yes?  Coco?  Well, it was a hell of a ride.  Ah, excuse me, Vice-president Coco, no one cares about                your Gammy.  Forget Gammy.  There's no Gammy.  Oh, no.  Gammy's gettin' upset!  Hey, people, people, people, people, people. Not bad, huh?                Excuse me.  Is that so? Or could it be that you're just a *little*                bit worried that you may have missed the boat?  Ha ha ha ha, oh all right, go ahead, deride, deride if                you must. But let me tell you something, with   So she's gorgeous.  Well have you got a picture?  Well, I have to see her.  Really?  Oh I would love that. You think he'd really do it?  Well I'm very excited about this. I've always wanted to                see how those sketch artists do it.  Pouty? I like that.  I'm excited about the pouty.  Oh yeah, you were right. She's gorgeous.  Well this worked out okay. So are you going to see the                police woman?  So I spoke a little to your little friend Denise last night.  Yeah for two hours. She's nuts about you.  Why didn't anything happen between you two?  Yes I did.  What do you think I said?  I told her the truth.  Yes, as I see it.  What hat?  No.  You only think that because you know me.  I noticed people staring at my head because they like what                they see.  Look, I guarantee she won't know.  (thinking to himself) Oh my god, there she is. That's the                face, just like the picture.  Yeah. Hi. It's great to meet you.  No, no. I just got here. A few minutes ago.  Well why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile.  That's an interesting question.  How so? I'll tell you how so. She's bald!  What do you think I mean bald? Bald. Bald bald.  She's bald.  Oh come on? No come on. She took off her hat and there                she was (waving his hand over his  Let me tell you something. No one walks into a beauty parlor                and says "Give me the Larry Fine."  You fixed me up with a bald woman.  Yeah, that's right.  So?  No I'm not. I *was* bald.  Elaine.  No, no, no Elaine.  Nooooo.  I tell you, when she threw that toupee out the window,                it was the best thing that ever happened to  And you know what else I've decided to do? I'm going to                keep seeing the bald woman.  Her scalp was clean. She had a nice skull. There just wasn't                a lot of hair on it.  Going to need a little more coffee here.  I'm sorry, Jerry I can't help you.  Jerry, I can't. It's like saying to Pavorotti, "Teach                me to sing like you."  Jerry, just remember. It's not a lie... if you believe                it.  Do you? That makes me so happy. Elaine's proud of me Jerry.  I got rejected by a bald woman. A bald woman rejected me.                Heh, you like that one? A woman  What?  This week. My father got a deal from a friend of his. It's Gore-Tex.          You know about Gore-Tex?  All right, all right. KNOCK IT OFF. Come on, let's go.  What for?  Why?  You mean just going there because I'm invited, that's rude?  So you're telling me instead of being happy to see me they're          going to be upset because I didn't bring anything. You see what I'm saying?  I don't even drink wine. I drink Pepsi.  Why not?  You telling me that wine is better than Pepsi? Huh, no way wine          is better than Pepsi.  I just don't like the ideas that every time there is a dinner          invitation there's this annoying little chore that goes along with it.  Oh, yeah. You wish you had this coat.  Oh, here we go. Why don't we get them a couch? Bring them a nice          sectional.  Why don't you just get some Ring Dings at the liquor store?  It's a funeral procession. . . . And I got news for you. I show          up with Ring Dings and Pepsi, I become the biggest hit at the party. People          be coming up to me, "just between you and me I'm really excited about          the Ring Dings and the Pepsi. Europeans with the Beaujolais          and Chardonnay . . .   Why not?  Are you kidding? People get spaces this good, they never give          them up.   All right, I'll tell you what, why don't you go into the store          and I'll wait in the car?   Because, I've got the coat. I can sit in the car and not get          cold.   Does the heater even work in this car?  Hey, there's a spot right in front of the liquor store. You see  You see, ho ho,   So alright, what are we getting? It's so hot in here!  What's that?  Twelve dollars? I knew we should have gone to the bakery. I guarantee          you they aren't getting no twelve dollar cake.  . . . Why not?  "throws your hips off kilter" So where's your money?          So what do you do?  All right here you go.  You can't - oh uh oh All right let's go.  Hey, hey What are you doing? You'll get us killed.  Don't go shouting we got a hundred dollar bill. People will be          jumping out of windows after us.  I am not buying something just to get change.  Pack of gum, okay here you go.  Why not?  A newspaper.  Clark Bar.  There's 22 dollars here.  I'm not getting a Penthouse Forum.  Oh, that's nice.  It's not real. They're all made up.  You know there is an unusual number of people in this country          having sex with AMPUTEES! . . . Penthouse forum, newspaper, gum, Clark          Bar.  Ah, great. With the wine I'm in over twenty dollars now.  Sorry, it's a new coat. It's Gore-Tex.  All right we got the wine. Aren't we lucky? We got wine. Imagine          if we didn't bring wine. We'd be shunned by society. Outcasts! WHERE'S          YOUR WINE? GET OUT!   Look at this? Somebody double parked and blocked us in. DOES          ANYBODY KNOW WHOSE CAR THAT IS? Maybe there's a note on it. No, no note.          Can you believe this?  I really can't comprehend how stupid people can be sometimes.          Can you comprehend it?  So you really understand my point about building a rocket and          double-parking.  Maybe it's not even stupidity. Maybe it's just a blatant disregard          for basic human decency. If this how dictator's start. Do you think Mussolini          would circle the block six times looking for a spot?  Ill tell you, if I was running for office I would ask for the          death penalty for double-parking. If this is allowed to go on this is          not a society. THIS IS ANARCHY!  No not really.  I know that's why I bought them but they're not comfortable.  We're really late now. We're in big trouble. Big trouble.  You know, Elaine.  . . . I'm a little scared of her.   Yes!  Did you ever see her lose her temper. I was once late because          I bought a Panama hat she grabbed it by the brim, pulled it down so hard          my head came right through the top of it.  Why didn't you wear a heavier coat?  Hey, hey that's great! That's very nice. We've been waiting twenty          minutes for you people? What do you think? You're Mussolini?  I wasn't talking to you.  Do chickens have individual personalities?  If you had five chickens could you tell them apart by just the          way they acted? Or would they all just be walking around? Cluck, puk cluck?          Because if they have individual personalities I don't think we should          be eating them. What's the matter with you?  We bought the wine here before, but now we're blocked in by some          car that's double parked and we're just waiting for the guy to pull out.  You know that coat was Gore-Tex. It was worth a hell of a lot          more than that cheap Chardonnay.  I'm cold too. At least you've got a coat. Let's get in the car.          Oh, my god that's Saddam Hussein.  Somebody double parked, we couldn't help it. It might have been          Saddam Hussein, we're not really sure. He had a British accent though.          What, what happened to you?   I had to give it to the liquor store guy.  I spilled some Chardonnay. So what did you get?  Cinnamon? Why didn't you get chocolate?  And your wine.  You can't handle the truth!(he salutes)  I'm working on my Jack Nicholson, You can't handle the                truth!(he   Yeah, I grabbed it on my way, I don't want my mother reading                it.  Yeah.  No, anything.  She'll open!  Yeah.  I was curious!   Maybe I can get her locked up.  Did you see that whale thing on TV last night?  I'm such a Huge whale fan. These marine biologists were                showing how   Whatever. (George looks to the table) Hey new tape recorder?  Hey  I do.  I'm just sayin' I wanna have some fun.  Come on. Ya wanna go get some lunch?  Yeah, I'm gonna go get a paper.  Keep your head down.  Diane DeConn? You saw Diane DeConn!  Yeah! How'd she look.  She did! What did she say?  George! She said George? She remembered my name. Diane                DeConn   OK, I'm tellin' you right now if your kiddin' around I'm                not gonna   Good. Cause if this is a lie, if this is a joke, if this                is your   Oh my god he's not kidding.  A what?  A marine biologist....why am I a marine biologist?  But I'm not a marine biologist!  So?  I didn't think it was a job.   What if she calls. What will I say?  Algae, obviously plankton, I don't know what else I can                tell you, Oh  Yeah, but what did you have to tell her that for. You put                me in a   Well it's not up my alley! It's one thing if I make it                up. I know   Why couldn't you have made me an architect? You know I                always  How'd she find it?  Then of course with evolution the octopus lost the nostrils                and took  Yeah, but enough about fish I can talk about other things                like...   Oh, they're busting!  So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you                boys, I   I know I was just telling them the story.  The sea was angry that day my friends, like an old man                trying to   I got about fifty-feet out and then suddenly the great                beast  Whatever.   Then from out of nowhere a huge title wave lifted, tossed                like a cork and I found myself on top of him face to face with the blow-hole. I could barely see from all of the waves crashing down                on top of me but I knew something was there so I reached my hand and pulled out the obstruction!  Oh yes they did Jerry they were all over me. It was like                Rocky 1.   She told me to "Go to hell!" and I took the bus                home.  Sand. It's everywhere  So then, as we were leaving, we were just kind of standing                there,   No, I froze.  Oh yeah. So wait, wait. A half-hour later I'm back in the                office,   Yeah. Anyway, he shamed me into it.  Right. And, and to cover my nervousness I started eating                an apple,   Right. So I call her up, I tell her it's me, she gives                me an   Oh, I don't get the enthusiastic 'Hi!', I'm outta there.  So, we're talking, and I don't like to go too long before                I ask them   She bought.  Then I got off the phone right away.  It's amazing: we, we both have dates on the same night.                I can't   I can't stand doing laundry. That's why I have forty pairs                of   Absolutely. Because instead of doing a wash, I just keep                buying   Yeah. We should do this again.  Oh, no, thanks. I can't drink coffee late at night, it                keeps me up.  OK.  Yeah, take it easy.  Take it easy, huh, take it easy.  (While preparing bicarb) She invites me up at twelve o                clock at   She invited me up. Coffee's not coffee, coffee is sex.  Coffee's coffee in the morning, it's not coffee at twelve                o clock at   Yeah, people who work at NORAD, who're on twenty-four hour                missile   I can't call her now, it's too soon. I'm planning a Wednesday                call.  Of course you do, but you're imagining a guy you like,                not a guy who   Yes, she wants me to like her, if she likes me, but she                doesn't like   Alright, I gotta make a call. Everybody out, come on.  Because I can't call a woman with other people in the room.                Come   Yes.  Oh Jerry, do you have any apples?  Uhm, hi, it's George, George Costanza, remember me? The                guy that   Got her machine. I'm dead, I'm a dead man. That's it. I'm                dead,   I don't know what the hell I said. I gave her an ultimatum                and   Now I'm in the worst position of all.  He did that?  Somebody did that?  Wait till you hear this (sees Donna). Whoa, ah, I'm sorry,                I   I just wanted to talk to him for a minute, but I'll come                back.  You sure?  OK.  Donna. Oh, you're the one that likes that commercial!  No, he, he didn't actually tell me that, uh, we were talking                about   Say? What? Nothing, I..   (To Donna) Why did you have to get me in trouble?  Boy oh boy.  Hello! Alright, we should be going. Come on .(Grabs Kramer)  Come on!  I can't believe I said that. You know me, I'm a vault.  You are not gonna believe what's going on with this woman.  OK, so you remember I made the initial call Sunday, she                doesn't call   I lost it.  She did. Today.  She called my office. She said she's been in the Hamptons                since   Exactly, but they're on there waiting. She said she can't                wait to   I'll meet her outside the building.  Or she goes for the bathroom. That's my only chance. Who                am I   You do it for me.  Come on, it'll be so much easier.  I'll tell her I bumped into you, I'm giving you a ride                uptown.  You do.  I can't do it. I'll, I'll keep her busy.  I think I may be in love with this woman.  Oh, you are such a wuss.  Yeah.  Well there is traffic. It might take her till eight-fifteen.  A signal, right, erm, OK, er OK, the signal is, I'll call                out 'Tippy   You don't like 'Tippy toe?'  Alright, er, OK I got it, erm, I'll sing.  Erm, 'How do you solve a problem like Maria?'  Oh, it's a lovely song. (Sings) How do you solve a problem                like   You pick it.  Peter, Paul and Mary.  You got the tape?  How do you feel? Confident?  You nervous?  Get up, get up, it's her. Oh, the hell with this, I'm scared                to   Hey! What are you doing here? I thought I was supposed                to call you   I, I couldn't wait. I was too anxious to see you.  Oh, this is my friend, Jerry Seinfeld. I just bumped into                him   You know, we could go uptown, and that way we could give                Jerry a   Don't you wanna go upstairs first?  Yes, yes, but er, I have to make a call, so...  I know Jerry. He has this phobia about public toilets.                I think we   Right, right.  No, no that can happen. I've, er, I've read about that                in medical   Uh, Carol, can I talk to you for a second? Right now.  Please, this is very, very important. (Leads her to other                room)  (Shouts from other room) Uhh, tippy toe! Tippy toe! Lemon                tree!  Carol, that's so rude. Please, I'm serious, just for a                moment, if   (To Jerry) Don't you find that strange?  Oh, uhhh...  Prognosis Negative!  Let's go, people, let's go! It's Prognosis Negative time, wa ha ha  Can't go, Why not?  I thought Kramer was watching.  Well so what's the problem, you just put some newspaper down.  You spritz a little Lysol on it.  So we're not going?  Oh. You still wanna go?  If you want.  Ponce de Leon? Okay. (to Jerry) You sure you don't wanna go?  What about this--  It's just we want you to go.  So how long did you live there?  That's pretty long.  It's not that long, really.  And then you came here.  I like herbal tea.  Chamomile's good. Lemon Lift. Almond Pleasure.  Jerry drinks Morning Thunder?  Morning Thunder has caffeine in it, Jerry doesn't drink caffeine.  You don't tell him?  That is so funny!  Wait, have you ever seen him throw up?!  Prognosis Negative!  Tonight's the night, right? Prognosis Negative?  What does this mean?  What is with this dog, I thought we were taking it to the pound.  Uh Jerry, how long will you be in there?  Uh why don't you wait then go in the movies?  And isn't it more fun using the urinal?  Hey, go.  What, are you doing me a favor?  How's it going?  Things are good.  I know.  Jerry gargles? Is that why he takes so long?  How come we never hear him?  Wait, wait, did you ever see him throw up?!  Oh.  I have nothing to say to anybody. I'm so uninteresting. I think I'm  All I know about is sports. That's it. No matter how depressed I get,  Know what? Ponce De Leon is sold out.  Nothing except Prognosis Negative.  I mean, I could understand if there was something else playing, but  What is this 'saving movies' thing? Something's playing, you go.  So, what? We're gonna do nothing now, this is crazy.  Of course it is.  Exactly.  Right.  And she'll still see it, you're not stopping her from seeing it.  Good.  Ridiculous!  Oh, you're dead.  And then I hear this rabbi on television, I mean imagine.  Ya know, I was just a little surprised.  What about all the loser stuff?  (Gets up to leave) Well, scintillating as always.  I'm going shopping with Susan.  Clothes shopping.  Ross'.  Yeah, it's her uncle's.  (As he leaves) One would hope.  I don't like it, it's red. It it's too flashy.  All right. Don't change me. Susan. Don't change me. Ya                know there are a lot  See now this I don't get.   The security guard.  Why does he have to stand?  But I mean look at him. He's gotta be on his feet like                that all day?  Aren't you concerned about the security guard?  (Thinking to himself) She's not concerned about the security                guard. What  Yeah. You like it.  Why, the color?  Too flashy?  (Obviously lying) No.   Let me ask you something. When you go into a store, does                it bother you   See, didn't bother Susan either. That's why I'm different.                I can sense  Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand                on his feet, in  What, he can't jump out of the chair? How long does that                take?  Would you get out of here. Who's gonna turn down a chair?                I would be  Who?  (Very loud in the direction of a waiter) I'm gonna need                a coffee here. Very hot! Boiling!  (To guard) Tired?  How come uh, no chair?  I, I couldn't help but notice that uh you don't have a                chair.  No I didn't mean to imply that you did. You're obviously                a very well   Would you like a chair?  Ah ha, Ah ha. You would, wouldn't you?  That's exactly my point.  Cause I tell you, frankly, I would like to walk in hear                one day and find  Who?  Bob Cobb?  Oh I missed the Maestro?  Huh. Your renting a house in Tuscany?  So what do you care?  Of course he is. There's got to be houses for rent in Tuscany.                Do you   It it's huge. It's probably like North Dakota.  It's a big region.  I don't know why I bother even talking to you.  All right.  So I spoke to the security guard.  Well it's tough to get a good read but I think if I brought                him a chair,  Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking                about a bar stool.  Oh I think I'd go for the back.  I suppose he could swivel. Hey maybe one of those director's                chairs. What  You mean one of those vinyl things?  Vinyl yeah, maybe.  Yeah, good luck. Hey I'll meet you outside.  What do you think about a rocking chair?  What's your name?  I'm engaged to Mr. Ross' niece. I'm probably gonna be taking                over this   Innocent mistake.  Well, here you go. What do you think?  Hey, I'm his nephew, all right? Don't worry about it. Go                ahead. Check it out.  [outside over the intercom] Yeah  [walks in] Ready?  [closes the door] Hey, Elaine  Coming to the airport with us?  Oh, the actress-waitress.  You just kick her out.  Yeah, well...a little ruff finding something good in  No no no, this one's different, this one's a beauty!  I haven't seen it yet, but it's a "two-bedroom",                it's  Uh, twice what you pay in here, but it's a great  Yeah, tell'm, but quickly, I'm double parked here.  Let's not forget the radiator, the steam has been on  Jerry, what do ya...you wanna...you wanna see the  [makes some weird motions] I walked in, your lobby  I don't know how you put up with this.  I didn't know there was a fireplace. A fireplace, this  [looking intensively at the form with the apartment  A garden! I can't believe there's a garden!  [to Elaine] You don't tip a gardener!  You don't need a gardener.  I have plants.  It's your decision.  Congratulations. [obviously not so thrilled by the  [outside over the intercom] Yeah, it's George.  [walks in and closes the door] Hey, what's goin' on?  Oh, Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry Jerry [said very quickly],  If you're having second thoughts, if you didn't want  No, I don't want it. I want it, if you don't want it.  No I, I want it if you don't want it!  No, I'm saying, if a situation arose in which you  [refuses to take the lease from Jerry; Elaine looks  It's your apartment!  Yes, but I am not taking it.  I, I don't know. [makes a gesture, that he doesn't  ...Who flips?...You'll flip, I'll call.  I'm good.  No catchin'.  Flip it. [Jerry flips the coin] Heads! [the coin hits  No, it hit the table, it hit the table.  INTERFERENCE! YOU CAN'T COUNT THAT. COME ON, ARE YOU  YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL THAT. THAT'S A RULE!!  Oh oh oh, all right, fine, Jerry, you win. Take it,  OK [they walk around each other]...OK. I'll choose  I want evens.  You got odds.  Right, ready.  Mine!  [Jerry wins, Elaine starts measuring up Jerry's couch]  [screaming in bathroom] WHAT DID I PUT UP TO? WHAT DID  [walks towards the table] I love the mirror in that  I don't know, I can't eat, ya, ya can't have anything  What?!  Why not?!  Oh, get out a here.  Mope?  No, impossible! It's your apartment.  You won the choose.  Well, me neither.  Definitely.  No, it's not a problem, I can get rid of the apartment  Oh, it's a great place, it's uh "two-bedroom"                uh, west  I don't know, what we're doin' here, this is  The table is interference, you know it!  It is too!  Hi, Carol.  We're really glad for ya. [very sadly]  We're aware of the proximity to the park, yes.  Nice meeting you. [shakes Carol's hand; they sit down  Where's the sunblock?  25? You don't have anything higher?  I need higher. This has paba in it, I need paba-free.  Yes, I have a problem with paba.  I know enough to stay away from it.  So are you going to Todd's party this weekend?  Gwen really wants to go.  No good?  Why'd you pick Hoover? Was he that interesting to talk                to?  Yeah I guess. What can I do? I gotta take her with me.                Todd introduced us, I'm obligated.  The Croat? [the tennis player]  Yeah, she's a B.L.  Beautiful lineswoman. I'm going to go to the concession                stand and get some real sunblock. You want anyting? Jerry? (Jerry                is staring at the lineswoman) Jerry?  Boy you are really smitten.  Cold? How are you going to do that? You're not one of those                guys.  They're not mocked and humiliated when they get to the                other side.  Wait a minute Jerry, there's a bigger issue here. If you                go through that wall and become one of those guys I'll be left here                on this side. Take me with you.  What are you going to say?  You think you're going to the other side with "Hi"?                You're not going to make it.  I don't understand things were going so great. What happened?                Something must have happened.  You're giving me the "it's not you, it's me"                routine? I invented "it's not you, it's me". Nobody tells                me it's them not me, if it's anybody it's me.  You're *damn* right it's me.  I know what you were trying to do. Nobody does it better                than me.  Yes well unfortunately you'll never get the chance to find                out.  Yeah so did I.  No. She tried to give me the "it's not you, it's me"                routine.  Yeah. Well aparently word's out.  Really? At the tennis match?  Get out of here. I didn't see any cameras there.  Cracks? What were they saying?  Maybe Gwen saw it. Maybe that's what did it.  She must have seen me eating it on TV.  Why not. I would be.  You're parents saw me on TV?  This is nighmare. Kramer how long was I on?  One-one-thousand, two-one-thousand, three-one-thousand.  Can we move on?  Yes I do.  Well I can't now, Gwen's going to be there.  "To the victor goes the spoils." What are you                going to do tonight?  Oh. (he stands there)  Well I was just going to wander the streets. Wouldn't want                to tag along with you or anything.  Jerry please, that's very nice, but, uh, (closes the door)                where would we be going?  So, I've got ice cream all over my face. There were no                napkins there. Whoever it was that's responsible for stocking that                concession stand cost me a relationship.  They're breaking up? How do you know?  What are they saying now?  (Holding his drink up to his mouth) Oh my gosh, I just                had a great idea. She could come to the party tomorrow and read                Gwen's lips for me.  (Puts nuts into his mouth, and in the process covers his                mouth) We bring her to the party, and she can tell me what Gwen                is saying about me.  (Puts his hands on his face, rubbing his eyes) Look. It's                a skill, just like juggling. She probably enjoys showing it off.  (Puts his arms in the air, stretching, and covers his mouth                with an arm) Could you ask her, just ask her. If she says no, case                closed.  She confused "six" with "sex"?  Well if she can't tell "six" from "sex"                then how is she going to lip read from across the room?  It's two completely different sounds. "ih" and                "eh".  It seems like a problem.  When is that car service comming?  If this lip reading thing works tonight do you know how                incredible this is going to be? It's like having Superman for your                friend.  If we could just harness this power and use it for our                own personal gain, there'd be no stopping us.  What?  ah.  Hey hey.  Why? Did she say something to you about why she broke up                with me?  I wouldn't hear of it, huh. It's none of my business. You                should try to find out everything you possibly can. In fact, I'll                even stay all the way on the other side of the room so there's no                chance of me overhearing anything.  (to the others) Let's go, let's go. All right what are                they saying?  What?  What?  So you're getting rid of me and now the two of you are                going to sleep together?  I heard your whole conversation.  (looks back to the group) I can read lips. You said let's                sleep together.  Sweep?  Cut it.  Cut it.  Cut it. (goes back to the group) (Yelling) Would you stop                signing? She said "sweep together" you idiots, not "sleep                together."  Ow. My eye, my eye.  She thinks I'm a nice guy. Women always think I'm nice, but women          don't like nice.   Why is nice bad? What kind of sick society we are living in,          when nice is bad?   Little cologne.   Monica wants me to wear it.   I'm too nice.   She wants me to take an IQ test.   No, she's taking this course in education for her masters. It's          part of her research project, I have to be a guinea pig.   You know, I can't talk to you anymore.   Yeah, and she's going to find I'm a moron. You know, people think          I'm smart, but I'm not smart.   I'm not going to break a hundred in this thing.   You don't listen when people talk to you anymore!   I'm sure I have a low IQ. I've been lying about my SAT scores          for 15 years.   What did I get or what do I say I got?   I say fourteen o nine (1409).   You're telling me.   You are my friend.   I tell you everything, right?   Well, this I take to the grave.   Hi.   I'm wearing some cologne, all right?   What's that?   Why what I do is so important? Why must I be always the vocal          point of attention? Let me just be, let me live.   I didn't take it yet.   What's casus belli.   Is it about me?   Yeah, fun. IQ tests are totally bogus. They prove nothing.   It varies.   145!   You should take the test for me.   Yeah, yeah I really had some guts back then. Why wouldn't we          do that again?   You could take the IQ test for me. I could pass it to you out          the window. We could do it, she lives in the first floor.   Why not?   I don't know, she lives right around the corner. Take it here          or go to the coffee shop.   You'll do it?   Yeaah, beautiful...[They try to hit a high five, but George hits          Elaine in the forehead.] Sorry...   You go in the living room. I'll take the test in here.   I can't concentrate in front of you.   Are you kidding me? This is the best tool we have today of measuring          a persons intelligence.   Well, I think you're wrong about that. And now if you would excuse          me, I would like to get started please.   Don't need it.   I'm sorry I'm sorry, here's the test. Thanks again for doing          this.   Eh, twenty to three.   Thanks again.   And don't settle for 145, you can do better, you're a genius.          Yeah?   Oh, it's locked?   Monica, I'm really focused here, this stuff's a killer.   Wish I could.   What did you go on a picnic?   Babu Bhatt? How I'm going to explain this?   Ok. [George opens the door.] Here you go.   Piece of cake.   What? I spilled some food on it.   What are you talking about?   From my pocket.   I eh, I had a sandwich in my pocket.   Yeah, had some coffee, yeah.   Where did I get the coffee? Where do think I got the coffee,          from the grocery store.   I walked.   I climbed out the window.   Of course.   The door? Why would I go out the door? The window is right here.          Coming up.   85!   85, Jerry! 85 IQ !   Oh, hello professor.   Please...   You should've seen her face. It was the exact same look my father          gave me when I told him I wanted to be a ventriloquist.   Whow, forget it.   You could do worst!   All right, I'll ask her.   How' you doing?   You know, it's the damnedest thing. I went out the window again          to get a cup of coffee...   Lets not stand here, we might run in to her.   That's a good score.   Italian.   This catalog is all about how to score in a foreign country.  Not that much.  Yeah, when the season starts. Right now, I sit around pretending                that I'm busy.  I always look annoyed. Yeah, when you look annoyed all                the time, people think that you're  I know what I'm doin'. In fact Mr. Wilhelm gave me one                of those little stress dolls.  I'll tell you what happened. I bet he got the AM/PM mixed-up.  uh-uh. What's with the bucket?  You put a hot tub... in your living room?  Is that tolerable?  He uh...doesn't have any running water?  Eh...come oooon...(starts stabbing the paper with the pen.                Mr. Wilhelm comes in)  Well...I've got a lot to do!  (smiling) Well, we're certainly glad that you could make                it.  Oh yes, Mr.Wilhelm, yeah...  Oh yeah, al-almost. Almost.  Well...maybe not as much as this bastard... (points at                Zeke, they all laugh) I can  Hey, you bastards.  I really like those sons of bitches.  Yeah! That's how they talk. You know, everyone's either                a bastard or a son of a bitch.  Yeah, yeah. That's how they talk in the major league. (laughs)  What's goin'on?  Hello?  (laughs) Yeah, it's me. Is this Clayton?  What are they doin' lettin' you bastards on an airplane?                Don't they know that's against  Listen. I want you guys to send along those agreements                the minute you land. Our boys  You tell that son of a bitch no Yankee is ever comin' to                Houston. Not as long as you   (Mr.Wilhelm comes in and hears George yelling) You tell                that son of a bitch no Yankee is  Mr.Wilhelm...  Well I-I...  Whoa...it's like a furnace in here!  Well what's in this giant box out in the hall?  It's huge!  (Jerry is going to his bedroom) What?  Jean-Paul?  You wanted to see me, Mr.Steinbrenner?  Oh no, Mr.Steinbrenner, I can explain...  (bored to death) Well, I-I just recently uh...  " That guy was amazing, he could dunk and he was my                height...What   "Jimmy, right."  "Ah! your just mad 'cause we beat ya."  "HEY!

(still puffing)" Whoa!!"  "Hey"  (head down low) I...I wouldn't know"  "It doesn't help"  "I'll see you."  (to Jerry) "You know those shoes that Jimmy had? I                cut a deal with   "There's a lot of money in this.. He's got a proven                sales method"  "He jumps!"  "Will you stop with the Jimmies"  "Ha..harrr."

"I have to go see Steinbrenner later. Mr Wilhelm told                him that I   "'Cause when he questioned me about it I was sweating                from the Kom   "George likes spicy chicken."

"Why would George steal from the Yankees?"  " 'course not"  "Sir?"  (energetically) "Well seems it's about time for George's                lunch."  Say it's Saturday night in Spain.

Oh. How's she doing?  Ah. You know, there's gotta be an easier way to open ketchups.          Ya-hah.  I've seen squeeze mustard. I've never seen squeeze ketchup.  Not necessarily. Mustard lends itself to the squeeze.  Oh, there's a difference. It's subtle.  Hey uh, isn't Elaine supposed to meet us?  What?  Wendy? Is that the uh, physical therapist?  Really?  You know, I'm down to one kiss hello. My aunt Sylvia.  (surprise) Huh. I never heard you say you admire me for   You're uh, physical therapist, right?

I still don't see why I can't ask her about my arm.  Why not?  I love these people, you can't ask 'em questions. (getting   (wiping the area with a hand) People think they're so   (regarding the menu) What're you getting?  Well, just tell Kramer to tell her.  You know, my arm feels a lot better. That Wendy really knows          (tearing out cheque) Yeah, same time. (hands over cheque) There          What for?  (agitated) Well, I, I couldn't come. I, I had to drive my   (harassed) Are you aware that I'm being charged for Tuesday's  (after Wendy and to the receptionist) Oh, you have a policy!          Well, it's less than twenty-four hours, so I guess I have to!  What d'you mean?  When did you leave the message?  (pointedly) Oh, I'm sorry, I require twenty-four hours notice          Will that be cash, or cheque?  (irascible) Oh, I see. So your time is more valuable than mine.          Elaine?  (leaving) Hah. Good luck.  Wednesday? That's your personal business?! (stalks over to the          I hear everything.  Yeah. Let's go.  (Shocked) She's pregnant? Leslie is pregnant?! Oh, see,                there is no justice.  (Sarcastic) Yeah, performance artist. She's a real performer.                A real trooper.  That woman was unequivocally the worst date of my life.  What, you don't think I can attract beautiful, intelligent                women?  (Sarcastic) Maybe for her new performance piece she'll                give birth on stage.  (Again, sarcastic) Oh, what a huge blow to the culture.  She dragged me down to that warehouse on the waterfront                in Brooklin to see one of her "performances".  God! She's cooking dinner for God! She's yelling and screaming,                and the next thing I know, she throws a big can of chocolate syrup                all over my new red  Oh, yeah, sure, accident, right. She was aiming right at                me like she was putting out a fire! Then, for the rest of the show,                I'm sitting there with chocolate all  And then, then, then she leaves with somebody else! Never                even, never even said goodbye! Never called me back.. Never apologized.                Nothing. Like I  I still have it. The collar's okay. I wear it under sweaters.  Let Maria Shriver give her a baby shower.  (Germanic) Ich bin ein sucker.  She doesn't deserve a baby shower. She deserves a baby                monsoon. She deserves Rosemary's baby!  Never said goodbye. Never apologized. Nothing.  (Still mad a Leslie) Never said goodbye. Goodbye!  Someday, before I die, mark my words - I'm gonna tell that                woman exactly what I think of her. I'll never be able to forgive                myself until I do.  I still won't be able to forgive myself - but at least                it won't be about this.  Sounds like a rough trip.  So, the college cancelled the gig?  (Modestly) Forget it.  It's nothing.  (Laughs nervously) ..Ulterior motive.  (Obviously knows that, but pretends he doesn't) What, tonight?                Now?  My place? NO, no, no. I hate my place. I don't wanna go                back to my place.  Yeah, I would. It's just, you know, I just ate a whole                pot roast.  Shouldn't we at least drop off your bag?  (Nervous) What are you talking about?  I am? What a strange coincidence..  (Pleading) You gotta let me go over there.  No, I'm gonna hold it under her nose so she can smell the                scent of stale Bosco that I had to live with for three years, and                I'm gonna say, "Remember this  (Boiling) What am I going to say?!  What did you go out with me for?! Just to dump chocolate                on my shirt and then just dump me altogether?! I don't deserve that                kind of treatment! What,  Watch me.  (Unconvincingly coy) About what?  Leslie.  George.. (She doesn't seem to recognize him) George Costanza.  (Laughs) You, I guess, you don't remember me.. but we actually,                kind of um.. went out.. a couple of years ago.. once.. remember?  You took me to one of your shows..  And, um, it was quite good. In fact, you even incorporated                me into the show. I'm not actually a performer. Although, my parents                felt I had talent..  Actually, I never had any formal training. I guess I'd                be better suited for improvs, or something..  (Sheepishly to Elaine) I'll be right back. (Leaves)  Every woman on the face of the earth has complete control                of my life. And yet, I want them all.. is that irony?  Hey, hey.  Elaine, Julie.  Hey, wanna get some lunch?  Ah, well, that's very mature. What about you?  Sure, all right, what do you want?  What big salad? I'm going to the coffee shop.  I've never seen a big salad.  Is that what I ask for? The BIG salad?  No, no, Hey I'll get it. What's in the BIG salad?  (???), we'll see you in a little while.  Oh, Sapphire. Uh ha   He can be pedantic. He can be pedantic.  Yes. Yes. You know what's interesting. The quarterback for the          Atlanta Falcons is Bobby Hebert. No "r" which I find fascinating.          You know it's Herbert h-e-r-b-e-r-t, Hebert h-e-b-e-r-t. "Hebert"          it's a fun name to pronounce. Try and say it Hebert. Take a shot. All          right. [check arrives] All right. I   No, Julie, Julie, don't insult me. You know, what difference          does it make who pays for lunch. It's totally meaningless.   Hey, hey.  No, you go Guggenheim. I'm not much of a Guggenheim.  Ya, you go.   Did you see what just happened?  Did you happen to notice that Julie handed the big salad to Elaine?  Well, she didn't BUY the big salad. I bought the big salad.   Yes it is. She just took credit for my salad. That's not right.  I mean I'm the one who bought it.   You think she should have said something?  Oh, I know.  You know you buy a big salad for somebody it would be nice if    Yeah, she's very lovely.  So did you enjoy your lunch?  oh, . . .because she handed you the bag. I could have handed          you the bag. She happened to pick it up at the restaurant even though,          . . .   . . . naw, it's just you thanked HER, and and oh, . . . what's          the difference?  It's just that I was the one who actually paid for the big salad.          She just happened to hand it to you. But it's no big deal.   No, no,  There is no problem. . . just a small miscommunication. Whereby          you thanked her instead of the person actually responsible for purchasing          the big salad.  You know, I think I could have played with dolls if their were          dolls in the house. It seems like fun to me. It doesn't seem like a gender          thing. I think I would like to play with dolls. What's so terrible?  A ha! We're just friends.   Oh, share.  Ha, ha ha uh, I'm not following that.   Well, she probably just assumed.   . . .uh, . . . wait a second. Are you suggesting that I went          out of my way to tell Elaine that even though you handed her the big salad,          that it came from me?   . . . WELL IT WAS A BIG SALAD. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW          IS, HOW DOES A PERSON WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE BIG SALAD CLAIM RESPONSIBILITY          FOR THAT SALAD AND ACCEPT THE THANK YOU UNDER FALSE PRETENSES - AH - AH?  You know, if it was a regular salad I wouldn't have said anything.          But you had to have the BIG SALAD.   Not as thin as you think.  The tag, huh?  Let me tell you something about that tag. It's no 31, and uh...let's          just leave it at that.  He scratches off a 32 and he puts in 31.  Well, this is the Jerry Seinfeld that only I know. I can't believe          I just told you that.  Well, Jerry doesn't want anyone to know.  Where did you get that from?  I never heard of that.  I've coupled! I've coupled!   This is totally different! That was my secret, this is Jerry's          secret! There's...there's attorney-client priveleges here! If I play it          by your rule, no one'll ever confide in me again, I'll be cut out of the          loop!  Hey.  I had a fight with Susan.  Oh...<is about to tell Jerry, but reconsiders> ...clothing,          something, I dunno. So, uh, what are you doing today?  Lena, how'd you meet her?  You met her a few weeks ago, but...?  So, uh...wanna double?  Well, I just had a fight - I need a group dynamic.  Just for these sponges?  I dunno.  I, uh...figure it's something. <Kramer enters.>  Yeah, the oceans really are getting very sudsy.  I'd get tired of it.  Mick Jagger.  Oh, well, I'm sure you can reach her...she's a poet. What does          a poet need an unlisted number for?  What are you looking at me like that for?  What are you talking about?  I know, but don't say anything to anyone. He told me not to tell          you.  Well, you know, I was thinking about what you said before, and...you're          right, I've never really been a couple, so...if that's the rule, then          I'm gonna go by the rule.  So, you wanna go home and...make up, officially?  What for?  Oh, o.k., yeah. Where am I gonna park here...? <Pulls over.>  Me run in? Why don't you run in?  Of course I do.  You know. You use the, uh...<mutters something unintelligible          under his breath.>  You know, the uh...<mutters it again.>  Wait, wait a minute...they don't have them anymore. I just found          out, they just took them off the market.  Yeah, so you gotta use something else.  O.k....<thinks> I think I know where we can get one.  Elaine? It's me, George. <Elaine opens the door.> Hey,          sorry to bother you so late. <To Billy> Hey! How ya doin.' <To          Elaine> Uh, did you get any of those sponges?  Well...Susan.  Susan loves the sponge.  What?  Elaine...let me just explain something to you. See, this is not          just a weekend routine...I'm on the verge of make-up sex here. You know          about make-up sex?  Elaine, can I just explain something to you very privately here?          Susan and I have been together many, many times now, and just between          you and me, there's really no big surprises here, so...make-up sex is          all that I have left.  Really? How'd she do that?  My Susan?  Because, Jerry, it's a couple rule! We have to tell each other          everything!  What?  You're cutting me off? No, no, no Jerry, don't cut me off!  C'mon Jerry, please! It won't happen again.  Hey, a "hit" is a totally different story.  So, Lena was upset, huh?  What, it didn't bother her?  What?  Too good...  I see what you mean.  Where's the depravity?  You know, you're nuts with these sponges. George is gettin' frustrated!  Elaine and her sponges...she's got like, a war chest full of          them.  Oh, no, no...condoms are for single men. The day that we got          engaged, I said goodbye to the condom forever.  Make-up sex? You have to have that right after the fight, we're          way past that.  No, no...I hate the condom.  I can never get the package open in time.  It's not that easy. It's like "Beat The Clock," there's          a lot of pressure there.  I'm trying, dammit.   I tried to tear it from the side, you can't get a good grip here.          You gotta do it like a bag of chips.  Would you wait a second? Just wait? <They fight over it.>  Well, I can see that. What do you have to do that for? Who cares          about your pants size?  I'd kill to be a 32.  That condom killed me. Why do they have to make the wrappers          on those things so hard to open?  You never run out, do you? <Jerry smiles.> Where's Kramer?          Everything's finished here.  Hey, where's you AIDS ribbon?  Gee, Kramer, I uh...I don't know what to say.  Should I give you my keys, is that the transaction, trading keys...?          Because Elaine has my keys.   I suppose I could.  Me?  Alright, stop it Kramer, you're freakin' me out. <The waitress          comes over.>  Yearn? Do I yearn?  You yearn.   Well, not recently. I craved. I crave all the time, constant          craving...but I haven't yearned.  Aw, Kramer, don't start...  I am not! What you call wasting, I call living! I'm living my          life!  No.  No.  No.  No.  Uh...no.  No.  I like to get the Daily News!  Why?  Yeah, I think I got a touch of something, too.  "These pretzels are making me thirsty"? That was one          line! You got fired!  Uh, no, I'm not.  You're not really gonna go to California, are you?  Anyway, so he gave me his spare keys, now he wants to have my          keys, so I need mine back from you.  I don't know. He said he wants to be my "key brother."          What for?  Jerry? Why?  So what?  Well, I don't see why if you have his, he should have yours.  What?  Alright, listen, I'll give you your spare keys, but I don't have          them with me. Can I please have mine to give to back to Kramer?  Yes, but I still don't feel right about letting you into Kramer's          apartment without his permission.  You never should have taken away his keys!  How'd the Mets do?  Yeah, coy.  Sure. <Turns around.>  No we're not.  Ask her about Kramer.  Look, I gotta tell ya...I been thinkin' about it, I just don't          feel right about letting you into Elaine's apartment.  Well, you know, I shouldn't have let you into Kramer's, now you          want to go into Elaine's...she entrusted me with her spare keys, how can          I just let you in?  Just because you have someone's spare keys, it doesn't entitle          you to break into their apartment. That's the reason you took away Kramer's          keys.  Yes, well, if you had never taken your keys back from Kramer,          he never would have taken his back from you and given 'em to me, in which          case I wouldn't have had to take mine back from her.  Nope, no can do.  Do you wanna fight?  I'll fight ya! Not the face! Not the face! <The struggle continues.>  You're right, how did I miss that? <Begins unlocking the door,          mutters under his breath> Maybe because it's a crock of sh*t.  Nothing.  Didn't say anything. (They go into Elaine's apartment.)  They were in here, I saw her put 'em in here!  Well, what do they look like?  Well, they're obviously not here.  Jerry, unless I pull down on this statuette and a hidden wall          opens up, we have checked every square inch of this apartment!  What?  What?  Lemme see this. (Tries to grab the papers.)  Gimme half!  Why didn't she tell us?  We hardly read anything!  He forced me to!  Yes you did!  What, you don't want me to hold your keys?  Alright, alright, fine. <Gives the keys to Elaine.>  Whose are these?  All right, Dad, we're five blocks from the house. Sit  What is that?   Are you supposed to yell it?   What happened to the screen door? It blew off again?   Why does she want you to be mad?   So what do you care what she thinks.   She probably gets that impression because you're cool.  Not really. Your voice kind of raises to this comedic  I told ya. Hey, any of you guys want to come out and help                me fix  Really? You wanna come?   Dad, the hinges are all rusted here. That's why the wind                keeps  Dad, what's all this?  You're selling computers?  Dad, you know what it takes to compete with Microsoft and  Wow! I didn't try that 'til I was 23.   All right, relax, tough guy. I got to go out to my father's  Kramer.   What-what are you doing?   Morning, ma.   Morning, dad.   What is Lloyd Braun doing here?   Yeah, of course she did. That's all I ever heard growing                up  (Inquiring about the chalk board) What is this?   You know what? It doesn't matter, because I quit!   You wanna sell computers? I will show *you* how to sell  Jerry, can I talk to you for a second? (They enter Jerry's  (hearing Jerry broke up with Patty) Are you still down                in  Well, I got just the thing to cheer you up. A computer!  What?   I-I'm already here. I'm here. I'm here. Uh, you know what?  I don't want to hear it, Kramer!   What signal? What-what signal?   If I do it, will you buy a computer?   Only if you buy. I gotta make a sale.   Will you shut up?!   Well, sure. They're Jewish, and you're a shiksa.   It means a non-Jewish woman.   You've got 'shiksappeal'. Jewish men love the idea of  I'll tell you what's insane: the price that I could get                you  There's porn.   Damn it!   (Entering Jerry's apartment with a cartload of computers)                Jerry,  What do you know? You were in the nut house.   I heard they found a family in your freezer   Jerry! I did it! Haha! I beat Braun!   Come on, wanna give me a hand with the computers?   Why couldn't you squeeze one of those stupid rubber balls  Oh, please don't tell me you love me again, Jerry, I can't                handle  All right... here goes...   So, that's it. All of my darkest fears, and... everything                I'm  Where you going? I-I thought I could count on you for a  I love you, Jerry.   You know, all these years, I've always wanted to see the  Well what about all the Lloyd Braun sales?   Dad, you really should lay off the 'serenity now' stuff.                'Hoochie mama'?   I never heard him say anything really funny.  You would think that, but either you're born with a sense                of humor, or you're not. It's not going to change even if you go                from the red sun of Krypton all  I don't know but he ain't funny.  Pardon?  Guys with cats.. I don't know.  Oh no. No, no,no,no,no. I'd have to advise against that.                What do you know this woman, a month? Let's see, you're going to                be with her seventy-two  (To Elaine) That's exquisite. Listen, uh, if it's not too                much trouble, could you pass me that paper over there?  (To himself) Up again?! This is incredible. I'm.. I'm getting                it.  A stock.  Did you ever meet my friend, Simons?  I don't know. But Simons said that if I wanted to get involved,                that Wilkinson would tell me the exact right minute to sell. You                wanna do it?  It's Sendrax. They've got some new kind of technique for                televising opera.  Some sort of electronic thingy.  (Unsure) Five thousand.. ten. Ten thousand.. Five thousand.  C'mon. Wilkinson's got millions invested in this stock.                It's gone up three points since I've been watching it.  C'mon, go for twenty-five hundred. We'll do it together.                Come on, come on. We're in it together.  That's it.  (Gesturing to Jerry) Check the raiser.  I'll have the tuna.  All Simons was able to find out is that he's in the hospital.  Of course he's been in touch with him. He's left two messages.                He just hasn't heard back yet, that's all.  Just give it a little more time.  Alright, alright. That's it. I'm gonna go down there.  To the hospital.  I'm going to find out what's going on. Alright?  So what? I'll start talking to him, you know, casual, and                I'll work my way around to it.  Maybe he's resting.  What are you, a doctor?  Today. I'm going today. Just don't do anything until you                hear from me.  (To woman, thinking she's Jerry) Boy, I have to get to                a bathroom.  Fifteen seconds.  Yeah, I mentioned Simons. Next thing I know - I'm in the                parking lot. Perhaps they had some sort of a falling out. I'll tell                you one thing.. I don't know  (Laughs) Not quite.  I'm keeping it. I'm going down with the ship.  Have something else. C'mon, have a little dessert?  Elaine, get something! It's all taken care of.  So don't finish it.  I don't like to discuss figures.  I don't know, what? Eight thousand. It's a Hyundai. Get                out of here.. I told you not to sell. Simons made money, Wilkinson                cleaned up.  No. You'd be surprised. You don't recover that quickly                from a nose job.  He chose the cats?  I told you those trips were relationship killers. Too bad                you can't get your buddy Superman to fly around the Earth at super                speed and reverse time.  Wilkinson's got a bite on a new one.. Petramco Corp. Out                of, hu, Springfield. I think. They're about to introduce some sort                of robot butcher.  Why do I get pesto? Why do I think I'll like it? I keep                trying to like it, like I have to like it.  Everybody likes pesto. You walk into a restaurant, that's                all you hear - pesto, pesto, pesto.  Where was pesto 10 years ago?  That's a tough minute. It's like waiting in the shower                for the conditioner to work.  Who?  A guy?  It's the pesto of cities. So..?  Oooh.  Oh, the busboy left the menu a little close to the candle.  Did I get him in trouble? Because of what I said?! I just                told him what happened.. he didn't do it on purpose.. (Mangager                and busboy are arguing. The  I can't believe it. He's going! He's fired!  I didn't know he'd get fired.  What if he's waiting for me outside? He pointed at me!                Did you see him point?!  Was it my fault?  (Eating a sandwich) Oh, like you really know busboys.  Hey, at least I was a camp waiter.  It was a fat camp. Those kids depended on me.  Then why don't you try and get him another job?  What? Did you get the busboy's number?  How did you get all this?  (Putting his jacket on) I'd like to apologize. I want to                tell him I.. I.. didn't mean to get him in trouble.  Yeah, I want to see if there's anything I can do.. maybe                get him another job.. maybe I'll hear of something.  It'll take to long.  (Unsure) I don't a..  Look, I really appreciate your coming, but if you wouldn't                mind - try not to say too much.  I don't know.  Certainly not.  Yeah.. yeah, we're - we're cool. (Knocks lightly. Kramer                takes charge by knocking on the door louder. The busboy answers)                Uh, I'm sorry to bother  This is a guy I know.. Kramer.  (To himself) Oh my God.  (Interrupting) Anyway, I just wanted to let you know I'm                really sorry that happened, and if I can help out in any way, I'll                certainly be glad to do that.  Oy uy uy.. (Antonio points to the sink) We really should                get going.  Hurry up.  (Gestures for Kramer to shut up) Once again, Antonio, I                can't even begin to say how deeply, deeply sorry I am about everything.                The job, the cat.. (A  (Hands Antonio a card) Here's my card. I'm in real estate,                so, if you're ever looking for something bigger, something nicer..                (Antonio is staring at him,  Anywhere in the city - I'll tell you the best public toilet.  Sperry Rand Building. 14th floor, Morgan Apparel. Mention                my name - she'll give you the key.  (Scoffs) ARe you kidding? Lincoln Center. Alice Tully Hall,                the Met. Magnificent facilities.  The busboy's coming?  He's coming up?! (Moves to the door) I'll check you out                later.  I'm the one he wants! He's coming to settle the score.  Oh, the hell with it. Let him kill me. I..  (Nervous, his voice cracks) Hey, Antonio. How's it going?  (Trying to be modest) Ah, come on..  It won't for a while. At least not until after the cast                comes off.  That's not how it happened. It's when he fell on him with                his knee.  So, much longer?  (Not wanting to make Elaine mad) I guess it's not important.  I should probably get going too. If I don't feed Pequita                by seven, she goes all over everything.. take it easy.  Hey, thanks for coming with me.  I confused it with another awning.  We're perfect. I timed this out so we would                pull up at the terminal *exactly* 17 minutes after their flight is                supposed to land. That gives them just enough time to get off                the plane, pick  up their bags and be walking *out* of the terminal                as we roll up.   What's going on? What are you doing? The Long                Island Expressway?   Oh, I had it perfectly timed out: the Grand                Central, the Van Wyck!   Do you know what happens if I miss him? I                don't get credit for the pickup and I lose my 50 bucks...  Really?  The Duty Free Shop? Duty Free is the biggest                sucker deal in retail.  Yeah, "duty". Do you know how much                duty is?  Duty is *nothing*. It's like sales tax...  I like to stop at the duty free shop.  They're not here! You cost me fifty bucks!  Look, we're wasting our time here! We're a                half-hour late, they've probably took it off the board already.  Canceled? Do I still get credit for the pick                up? I was here!  No... What guy?  Listen, you go over to the ticket counter,                I'm going to go stop in the gift shop and pick up a copy of Time magazine.                There's supposed to ba blurb about Jerry in it and I think                he mentioned my name!  Gee, I'm sorry... I got here first.  You don't understand, there's a *blurb* about              me in this magazine!  Umm... No.  But you are Blanche... You *are* in the shackles.                Oh, I can't wait to read my *Time* magazine! Laaaast copy, too.                Maybe I'll read it tomorrow-- in the park! It's supposed to be                a beeyootiful day! Have a nice life... sentence, that              is!  Laguardia? All right, let's go. C'mon...  My name is not mentioned in this blurb...  Who's Grossbard?  Hey Kramer, c'mon-- it was 240 bucks twenty                years ago...  No-no-no, Kramer. Kramer! Kramer! You *cannot*                abandon people in the middle of an airport pickup! It's a binding social                contract.   Well, You're not gonna believe it...  The plane's been re-routed *back* to Kennedy.              We've got 45 minutes.  There it is. Gate 46... We got plenty of time.  How you gonna catch him? He's probably boarded                the plane already.  My credit card?  I'm not gonna give you my card unless you                tell me what it's for!  What, are you, nuts? You're gonna spend more                on the ticket than you're gonna get back from Grossbard.  This is a *great* idea! Here... use this one.                I get frequent flyer   Super Savers? Are they refundable!?  You bought non-refundable tickets, you idiot!

Excuse me, are you gonna be very long?  He knows I'm waiting. He sees me. He just doesn't wanna                look.  I just can't believe at the way people are. What is it                with humanity?   If anything happens here, can I count on you?  If we decide to go at it.  I have to get in touch with Tatiana! And look at his little                outfit.   I don't know her.  What are they gonna do?  For 50 bucks? I'd put my face in the soup and blow.  What were you doing?  Alleluia.  Excuse me, I was waiting here.  I've been standing here for the last ten minutes!  That's not the point. The point is I was here first.  Does she care? No. Does anyone ever display the slightest                sensitivity  Oh that's OK, really, don't worry about it.  Yeah, well, he probably bought it.  I shouldn't even tell you this.  Well, after dinner last week, she invites me back to her                apartment.  Well, it's this little place with this little bathroom.

Jerry it's funny , Paula and I actually met because of                Elaine.  ..And I went down there one time to see...  If Elaine wanted to get some coffee.  Are you through?  So Anyway, I started to compliment Elaine on her sketches                and it turns out,they're Paula's.  Oh! Dropped a napkin...(Whispers) Jerry!  What are you doing?...She had those nuts in her mouth ,                she just spit them out.  Well I've done that.  Haven't you kissed her?  Excuse me just for a second. ( fixes his hair looking at                his reflection in a coffee pot.)  This is dating , you can't leave anything to chance.  Hehummm , Yeah!  No problem.  Well , it was very nice meeting you Shelly and Jerry be                careful ,there's a lot of nuts out there.

How can you possibly like                somebody ,if you think they look like this?  (gets up to leave the table) HELLO!!! (angrily)  You enjoying yourself? (More laughs from Elaine)  You see. You see! Listen when is your next drawing class?  All right, I want you to do me a favor.  I want you to find out is she likes me.  But she's gonna know that I like her more than she likes                me.  yeah!  Hum..( to Elaine) Hey! did you talk to Paula?  So what did she say?  She said she liked me. No kiddin' she said that?  Those were her exact words, I like George.  Ha Haaaaaaa...

No...Why should that make any difference to you?  Of course not. You don't care what I look like.  I suppose I could just pull this out ( his tucked shirt)and                walk around like this and you wouldn't care?

He got me a piece of paper                saying "I've given your gift to someone else!"  Don't you see how wrong that is?! Where's your Christmas                spirit? And eye for an eye!  Nothing. It's a card from my dad.  It's nothing, stop it..  (Interrupting) Jerry, No!  No!  (pleading) Alright..  Jerry! Stop it!  I can't take it anymore! I'm going to work! ARe you happy                now?! (Gathers his things, and runs out of the coffee shop. Elaine                and Jerry laugh hysterically)  So, attractive one day - not attractive the next?  Yes, I am familiar with this syndrome -- she's a two-face.  (Annoyed) If that helps you..  (Identifying what Jerry said) Clint Eastwood!  Hey, check this out. I gotta give out Christmas presents                to everyone down at Kruger, so I'm pulling a Whatley. (Give a Christmas                card to Jerry)  (With pride) Made it up.  What do you think?

(Flicks rubber band tward the kitchen) Hey,                take a look at this. (Hands Jerry Kruger's check)  I don't know.  I've been doing a lot of thinking. This might be my chance                to start giving something back.  I'm serious.  I think I could be a philanthropist. a kick ass philanthropist!                I would have all this money, and people would love me. Then they                would come to me.. and  Well, there could be.  Well, I - I could, Uh, I could give the money back. Here.                (Holds it out)  Well, sir, I - I gave out the fake card, because, um, I                don't really celebrate Christmas. I, um, I celebrate Festivus.  Festivus, Sir. And, uh, I was afraid that I would be persecuted                for my beliefs. They drove my family out of Bayside, Sir!  Oh, no, Sir. Festivus is all too real. And.. I could prove                it - if I had to.  Happy Festivus!  Yo, dad. This is my boss, Mr. Kruger.  Dad, he doesn't need to see the pole.  Happy Festivus! (Sees Elaine) Yama - Hama!  Embracing my roots.  Busted cold.  Oh, God.  Not the feats of strength..  Kramer! You can't go! Who's gonna do the feats of strength?  Oh, please, somebody, stop this!  Oh, come on! Be sensible.  Ow! .. Ow! I give, I give! Uncle!  (Resenting the fact. Nodding) I am aware.  A billiard parlor?  Well, that's.. Elaine!  (Sliding over to make room for her) Sit down. Join us, please.  (Somewhat stern) Oh, the thing's cancelled. Sit down.  (Confused) What photo?  (Muttering out, not really wanting to talk about his family)          When the Costanzas came here, one brother stayed behind.  I don't know what you're getting all riled up about. There are          probably a million Costanzas-  Really? Why?  Who?  Yeah.. (Trying to remember) Poverotti.. Domingo.. and.. uh..          the other guy.  Hey, buddies.  Oh yeah.. (Starts to open it) Sally called Susan - said you guys          really hit it off.  Pretty chintzy, huh? Considering the money she makes.. She's          a big executive for Federal Express.  No, no. Forget it. I don't want it. Let's just get rid of it.  I doubt it. You know what he's doing now? He's putting a pool          table in my old bedroom.  What's all this?  (Muttering to himself as he walks to the bedroom) More stuff..  Oh my God! What is that?!  (Staring at the doll) This doll (Pointing) looks like my mother.  I know it's a doll, but it looks like my mother!  What is this thing doing here?  Uh, I'm sorry, I can't do this..  I feel like I'm in bed with my mother.  (Sitting on the sofa) I'm on no sleep, bro.  (Muttering) Susan has the doll collection.. one of the dolls          looks exactly like my mother.. she likes to sleep with it.  (Long pause) ..Felt like it. I tell you, this doll is pretty          spooky. (Takes off his glasses, rubbing his eye) It's freakin' me out          man. And now I got to go back out there and pick up this doormat.  I don't. Susan wants to have it out when Sally comes tomorrow.  Yeah, (Smiling) Susan said you'd be excited.  Susan's college roommate.  So call her up and tell her to bring you another one. She'll          be delighted to talk to you.  You see?.. You see?!  Jerry, come on. If my mother keeps shrinking, this is exactly          what she's gonna look like in ten years!  I tried! I almost threw it down the incinerator, but I couldn't          do it. The guilt was too overwhelming. (Grabs the doll, opening the door          to leave) Susan's so attached to this thing.  Hi, Elaine.  (Losing it) Don't tell me how to eat!  (Trying to keep it down) Because I like this one! (Notices people          staring at him, he quickly gets up, collecting the his coat and the tiny          replica) C'mon, let's go. Let's go! (On his way out, he stops in front          of a woman blocking his path) Oh, hi.. (Embarrassed about the doll, he          sheepishly walks out)  I just wanted a second opinion.  (To Susan) I told you it looked like her..  You think she's happy?  (indicates with his head) The cashier.  (surprised) You know her name?  I don't think I've ever spoken to her.  (gesturing with flyer) With Spartacus?  Why would I spend seven dollars to see a movie that I could watch          on TV?  Lloyd Braun? What d'you have to meet him for?  Really?  (thoughtful) Breakdown, huh?  Hello, Lloyd. How you doing?  I don't chew gum.  You know what? I think this Ruthie Cohen gave me the wrong change.  Hey.  (almost gleeful) After Dinkins lost the election, he had a complete  The whole time that I was growing up, all I ever heard from my          mother  Right, gotta get going.  Nah, I gotta deliver some Christmas presents to my parents.  Why d'you think I'm going now?  Hey, Mr Lazzari.  Yeah, yeah. Just delivering some presents to my folks.  Yeah, eighty-three. Used to belong to John Voight.  Something like that.  Oh, no no no no. Go ahead, Pop, you always knew your cars.  Hey Deena, come on, give us a hug. (they hug) Oh my gosh, you    Yeah, yeah. Speaking of crazy, did you hear about Lloyd Braun?  I know. Completely bonkers!  Pop? What happened to Pop?  (a little worried) He uh, he doesn't have the auto shop any more?  (very worried) Uhm, I, I gotta go.  I just remembered, I gotta be someplace. Yuh-hu-hur, that's enough.          Pop.  Pop! POP!!  'scuse me. I uh, I was in here this morning and uh, I believe          I paid you  Oh, I think so, and I can prove it. You see, I was doodling on          the bill  Fine, I'll buy a pack of gum.  I don't.  I know I gave it to you.  (frustrated) Fine. Fine. (to customer) Excuse me. (heading for          the door)  Well, you know. (grins, snorts) It's understandable.  Warning signs?  (disbelief) What? (laugh) Wh... what're you talking about? I'm          not the  All my friends do that.  You see that woman on the horse? (points)  She stole twenty dollars from me. (getting angry) Yeah, I might've  (rising to his feet) Hey! Hey, you! (setting off after her) Come          back  I'm telling you, that cashier is riding horses on my money.  (glances in mirror) Alright. Alright.  (getting annoyed) Hang on, it's warming up!  (angrily) Oh you mother...  Hey! What is your problem?  Oh, hello, it's you! (angry) Listen lady, I got six minutes left          on that  Aah! Fire!  (shouting) Fire!!  Your hose! Where's your hose?!  The Jon Voight car is no more.  No kidding?  Hey, thanks. I owe you a big one.  (staring at the wreck) Whatever.  You saw him. He was fiddling with the engine. God knows what          he did  No, not Lloyd Braun. But the cashier.  You remember the woman on the horse? She wanted my spot.  No, she wasn't on the horse.  That's right.  (points) And him!  Yeah, yeah, the flower guy. Listen, I know this all sounds a          little  I can't believe it. Look, that's Jerry Seinfeld.  Jerry Seinfeld. My best friend. He can explain all of this. (calls          to  Jerry! Over here Jerry. It's me!  Jerry, where y'going? It's... what're...  Yeah, yeah, but he doesn't wear glasses.  I know. Don't you see. (emphatic) He was doing it to fool Lloyd          Braun!  Look, Deena, I know you think I'm crazy, but I'm not. This is          just a  Believe me, I am not crazy.  Yeah, yeah. You really cashed in on that favor pretty quick.  (angry undertone) Oh, I'm gonna give you a Royal bearing. Wait          a minute,  (handing over a bill) Can I get a pack of gum, please?  What? Huh, so I had it all along. How d'you like that? (snorts)          I guess  No, no. Deena, it's not what you think.  Th... this isn't mine.  I got it from the Institute. The Institute.  (shouting) Dee... Deena!  So, she went out with you on a first date.. and it was                her birthday?  Is she socially awkward?  Well, maybe she decided to celebrate her birthday on the                Monday after the weekend.  Eh, I can't. I gotta go down to the foundation. I'm interviewing                high schoolers for the Susan Ross.. scholarship.  Nope!  Nope! (Starts heading for the door)  Noo!  (Standing in the doorway) I'm fine with it! Fi-hi-hi-hine                I say! (Leaves)  Quick, what's your favorite animal?  (Disappointed) A frog?  (Annoyed) Frog is wrong.  (Reading) I see here that you play the harp.. tell me,                why do you have to tilt it? Can't you just build it on an angle?                It'd save you a lot of trouble.  (Annoyed) Yeah, yeah. We'll, uh, let you know.  (Reading) I see your G.P.A's a 4.0.  so, uh, Steven.. I see you're president of the chess club.  Who's your favorite chess player?  Right. (Mumbles) Nastercoff.. What country is he from,                again?  (Gets up, stopping him) Woah, woah, woah! What are you                telling me for? You really had me going, there! C'mon, sit down.                (They both sit back down)  So, she's the loser of the group. Every group has someone                that they all make fun of.. Like us with Elaine. (Jerry thinks about                this, then shakes it off)  Are you looking deep down at the real person underneath?  (Changing subject) Hey, I htink I may have found someone                for the scholarship.  I'm interviewing all these annoying little overachievers..                finally, this kid walks in - Steven Koren - a regular guy.. likes                sports.. watches T.V..  (Defensively) He knows how to read. And he also knows finishing                an entire book doesn't prove anything. And get this: he's into architecture.  Yes. With a little guidance, Steven Koren is going to be                everything I claim to be, only for real. That's my dream, Jerry.  Hey.  Ladies and gentlemen, this (Opens the door, Steven is standing                there) is Steven Koren. His G.P.A. is a solid 2.0! Right in that                meaty part of the curve -  I'm sure we're all aware of the flaws and biases of standardized                tests..  Besides, Steven Koren has the highest of aspirations. He                wants to be (pauses for effect) an architect.  (Laughs) Steven, nothing is higher than an architect.  (Mutters) No, it's not.  (Irritated) It's called a T-square.  I was betrayed! That kid was like a son to me. And if there's                one person you should be able to hold down, it's your own flesh                and blood. Like my  You're spending the weekend with Ellen?  (To Kramer) You want to start?  Jerry, this whole Ellen situation.. has gone far enough.  (Concerned) Why're you doing this, Jerry? Is it your career?                Things will pick up.  I though we said we weren't going to discuss that now!  Of course he should consider it, but now is not the time!  Well, Steven, I, uh.. (All the sudden, a small gang steps                out of nowhere, surrounding George)  Oh.. nice.  What about architect, Steven?  Yeah, and I - I heard you got on their good side. Now,                what'd you do?  (Frantic) Kramer, do you know what those guys are gonna                do to me?!  You mean, like, a former member?  Hey, Van B. Boys.  Now, fellas, fellas.. easy. You wouldn't want to beat up                on one of your own.  Right.. the sign. (Hesitates, then makes a series of stupid                gestures)  (Defensively loud) It was when I was banging!  Love to! (Cracks his knuckles, then winces under the pain)  Alright, alright! (Goes out onto the sidewalk. The Seinfelds                walk by) Seinfelds!  Shhh! Listen, you gotta do me a favor. Give me your wallet.                I'll give it back to you later.  Eh, they're trying to pick out a new couch - you don't                want to know. (Remembering the watching Van Buren Boys) Give me                your wallet, or I'll spill your  Come on, hurry up, old man! I'm an animal!  (Pleading) Please, please, they're gonna hit me! (Attempts                to grab Helen's purse, she starts hitting George defensively, he                backs off)  I think she finds my stupidity charming.  Yeah, anyway, she's uh, having some kind of a family lunch, I'll          swing by after.  Yeah, I'll zip in, "How do you do?", zip out. She'll          love me.  Y'know, I'm better with the mothers than I am with the daughters.  Well, if I could talk to the mothers and have sex with the daughters,          then I'd really have something goin'.  Yeah.  Hey! (heads toward bathroom)  (inside bathroom) Nah.  (emerging from bathroom, buttoning his shirt) A gymnast! I can't          believe it, you didn't tell me she was a gymnast.  What, I'm puttin' my shirt back on.  I take it off when I go to the, uh, y'know, to the "office".  Well, it frees me up. No encumbrances.  ALL the way, baby!  Always.  Oh, no, no, not at all. No, I have always felt that the most          important thing in the world is spending time with family.  (hesitates) Very close, yes. Almost painfully close.  Mind? Why would I mind? I would love to wait! (shakes hands with          Nana) Nana, nice to see you. Ni-ni-ni-ni-NANA! (embraces another guest,          kisses her) Aunt Phyllis, always a pleasure. What a pleasure! Hey, let's          do this again real soon. I had fun, huh?  Oh, no no no, I'm fine. Let me help you with these dishes, huh?  No, I know I don't have to, I want to.  I'd argue if I could, Mrs. Enright. (exits) Here we go, all right.  (spits out mouthful of food): Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!  No, no. No, no, no. It was not trash!  Yes.  It wasn't down in, it was sort of on top.  Above the rim.  It was on a magazine! And it still had the doily on.  One little bite.  But I know who took the bite. It was her aunt!  (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, it was          not IN the garbage. It was above the garbage. Hovering. Like an angel.          Of course I know your aunt bit it. I kissed her goodbye. Listen, can I          tell you something else? In my family, we used to eat out of the garbage          all the time. (Jerry makes a face) It was no big thing. That's right.          Oh, okay. Buh-bye. (hangs up phone) I'm back in, she gave me a second          chance.  Yes, good for me!  Yes, flowers. I will get her flowers, I will go to the florist!  Did you pass your stone yet?  (singing as he exits florist with bouquet and a cup of coffee)          "...tootsie, good-bye. Too-too, tootsie..." (takes a drink,          makes a face, shouts back at shop) You call this coffee? (dumps out coffee          behind him, accidentally hitting a parked car's windshield)  I'm sorry! I'm terribly sorry! I- I-  Oh, sure. Of course. (looks for place to set down flowers) Um,          uh, could you hold these? For just a second, just a second. (grabs newspapers          from trash bin, begins wiping windshield) Here you go, now don't worry          about a thing. It's gonna be fine. Here we go. Look at this shine.  Look at this sparkle. (looks up, sees Lindsay's mother) Mrs.          Enright! (runs after her) Mrs. Enright! Mrs. Enright!  (on phone, as Jerry gestures beside him) No, Lindsay, I had accidentally          spilled coffee on the gentleman's windshield. Why would I do that? I have          a job! Well, did she see a squeegee? Well, you're not going to make a          dime without a squeegee. That's right, that's right, just tell your mother          it was all a big misunderstanding. You won't regret it. Okay, I'll see          you later. Buh-bye. (hangs up)  You think I'm going down?  I know.  Well, here we are.  Maybe I could just use the bathroom.  Whew! Anybody see that poster in there? That is weird, wild stuff,          huh? Whew!  No. We're supposed to tell him tonight.  Susan wants me to be there.  (Reluctantly) Yeah.  I didn't burn it down - Kramer did!  Yeah, I know what happened.  (Getting frustrated) I know.  Listen, maybe we shouldn't start writing today. I got a                lot on my mind.  (Letting his conscious get the best of him) I wonder how                Susan's father's going to react to this. Alright, what- what's the                worst he could do? So you burn  We could build a cabin like (Snaps) that.  (Looking over the writing materials they just bought) Bics?                What, d'ja get, bics?  Well, I like a rolling writer. They're very smooth.  (Still standing) So, you're gonna sit there?  (Offering) Drink?  (Uncapping his pen) Alright, here we go.  Weren't you supposed to call Elaine?  Alright, here we go. You got it?  Here we go.  (Holding out his arms - giving praise) It's beautiful.                Now, what do I say?  Alright, let's go.  yeah, Kramer, we're, uh, kind of in the middle of something                here. We're trying to do a little work..  What are you, Crazy? I can't ask the guy for more cigars                after you burned down his cabin!  Kramer, please.  Kramer, I can't help you. You're gonna have to get them                some place else.  (Getting up) You know what? Maybe I should take off.  Well, you know, I gotta go to, uh, Susan's parent's house                for dinner.. and, you know, I want to shower first.. and I want                to leave myself plenty of time.  I think we got a bite on it. (Exits)  Ohh, I have tremendous respect for people who work with                feet. I mean, to dedicate yourself to the foot - you're toiling                in virtual anonymity. I mean..  Oh, uh, the cigars.. (Chuckles nervously) I'm, uh, suckin'                'em down. I'm puffing my brains out, yeah.  (Impersonating Carson) I didn't not know that. Weird. Wild.                (Susan and George both laugh)  Oh, well, so what? Laughter - what is that? I mean, what                is the point of opening your mouth and going "Ha, ha!"?                What is that? "Ha, ha!"?  (Even more nervous than before) Oh, the, uh, the cabin..                well, (Clears throat)  The cabin.. (Laughs nervously) Well.. (Pauses as he thinks                of a way to break the news, then decides to pass it off) Susan?  (Annoyingly butting in) Kinda like Superman's fortress                of solitude.  S, uh, Superman - he, uh, built the fortress of solitude                up at the North Pole, to, uh, you know, sort of get away from it                all..  (Extremely blunt) Burned.  Burned.  (Laughs) yeah, burned. Whoo..  Eh, but, you know, Mr. Ross, if - if you look at the whole                situating, what with it being your cigars, and everything, it's                really rather ironic - one might even  Wo-hoah! What did you do?  Yeah, right.  Yeah, woman have no problem getting the hand off. How do                they do that?  Alright, so, go ahead.  (Expressing shock) Woah. Whoa! Woah!  (Putting his hands up) Alright, alright, hold on! (Jerry                has George's full attention) Time out! Woah, woah! (Scooting in,                giddy) What did she say?  No, I don't know. How do I know the usual?  (Picking up the ketchup) What typical? Gimme typical. Gimme                some typical.  (Breathing deeply) That's very dirty. (Jerry nods) That's                absolutely filthy.  (Yelling out to a waitress) Gonna need some water here!  Ok, what did you say?  Of course.  (Takes a few seconds to mull this one over. Shooting Jerry                a confused look, he repeats it) "The panties your mother laid                out for you"? (Jerry nods) What  Well, how did she react?  Well, that's not offensive. (Reflects) It's abnormal, but                it's not offensive.  Yeah, yeah. He went into the bedroom and started sobbing.  Huh. (Makes a "over his head" gesture with his                arm) C'mon, let's go, go. We got a lot of work to do today.  That's right.  Okay.  Here we are.  Let's do it.  Okay.  What'dya got?  Don't be silly.  (Scoffs) No, I told you, I'm not gonna do that.  (Standing up, still waking up) Alright, you know what we                should do? We should go to the movies. Get away from this script                for a while..  Alright, I just have to go over to the Ross' apartment                and drop off Susan's sunglasses. You'll come with me?  No, no, no, no.  Hi, how are ya? (They kiss)  (Chuckling) yeah. Uh, oh, here's your sunglasses. (Hands                them to her)  Ohh, hey there, young fella. (They shake hands) What's                your major?  Well, you should always consider podiatry. (Patting Ricky                on the shoulder) There's nothing wrong with the feet. (Ricky looks                critically back at George)  Oh, sure. (Holds the box out as Susan takes out a few letters)  Well, we.. we, we, ah..  We really should be, uh, heading out..  You know, the time..  Well, we really should be-  Uh, heading out. Jerry really hates to miss the coming                attractions.  yeah, time is what he's indicating there..  Uh, anyway, (Waving bye to everyone) onward and upward.  Alright, here we go.  Come on now.  Here we go.  You got it.  Ok, so, what'dya got?  Alright, so, we need something..  "How's it going?" - beautiful.  (Nodding, writing) "How's it going?"  I'm writin' it. "How's it going?"  Oh, uh, "The Falconer" by John Cheever. It's                really excellent.  That's it. This is it. I'm done. Through. It's over. I'm                gone.  Guess what.  Kramer. Guess what.  I quit my job.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I go in to use his private bathroom, everybody uses it,                and then I  I snapped! It was the last straw. [sighs]  Nobody's hiring now. The market's terrible.   I like sports. I could do something in sports.  You know, like the general manager of a baseball team or                something.  Well, it doesn't even have to be the general manager. Maybe                I could  What about that?  Well, that's really not fair.  Movies. I like to watch movies.   Do they pay people to watch movies?  That's true.  Right.  [scoffs] Those unions. [sighs] Okay. Sports,...movies.                What about a  I think I'd be good at that. I talk to people all the time.                Someone  Yeah. A couple of people. I don't get that, though. Where                do you  You can't just walk into a building and say " I wanna                be a talk  It's all politics.  This could have been a huge mistake.  [sighs] What should I do?  Go back?  You mean just walk into the staff meeting on Monday morning                like it  Just..go back. Pretend the whole thing never happened.  I was just blowin' off a little steam. So what?  I'm emotional.  Never happened.  How ya doin'?  What? I work here.  What quit? [laughing] Who quit?   Yeah. Good weekend.  Aw, she's gonna be a fine sailor.  What?   When?  Oh, what? What? That? Are you kidding? I didn't quit. What?                You  Come on. Will you stop it.  Teasing.  I don't know where you're getting this from. I....you're                serious  " I'll always be a winner and you'll always be a loser."                This is  No. That's not that.  No.  I've got some plans. I got plans.  What's the difference?  I'm gonna slip him a mickey.  You don't understand. He's got this big party coming up.                He's been  No. No. No. No. No. Don't worry. It's perfectly safe. I                researched  This is what they would do in the movies! It's a beautiful                thing!  Nah.  I got a sauce.  And Elaine is gonna keep him busy.  I told her what a sexist he is. How he cheats on his wife.  But she didn't know he doesn't recycle.  Revenge.   There's no chance of that.  That's him over there. The one that looks like a blowfish.  Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing this.  This is by far the most exciting thing I've ever done.  First time in my life I've ever gotten back at someone.  That's exactly what I told Jerry!  Yes!  God, I've never felt so alive!   You go over there -  You start flirting with him and I'll come by and, while                you're  [whispering] Glenda, can I ask you a favor? Can I have                this seat?  [whispering] I can't explain. It's very important that                I sit here.  [whispering] Okay. Okay. Fine.  I'm gonna count to three. If you don't give up the chair,                the wig  One...  Hello, Rick.  That's right, Ricky Boy, it's me!   Oh!  Boom!  Oh.  You want me to come back? Uh...  Rick.  Uh, Rick..  Rick.  Drink up. I like history. Civil War. Maybe I could be a                professor,  I like horses. Maybe I could be a stable boy.  Nah. It's probably a union thing.  Your wake up guy asked you out?  Now you're off on a topic.  You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know          you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking          blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her.   [ rubbing his eye] Ow, Ow you squirted me.  Boy, it stings.  No.  No, not that I know of. (winks)  Morgan? No. He's doing a great job. (winks)  No problem here.  I had no idea.  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's from that grapefruit that          Jerry squirted at me.  Yeah, yeah. You must have squirted a piece of pulp in it too.  Pulp can move, Baby! Why didn't you eat a real breakfast?  Wait a minute. I must have been winking down at the office. That's          why Mr. Wilhelm was acting so mysteriouso.  Hu, oh. No he thought I was hiding something from him about Morgan.          Yeah.  It's an inter-office envelope. It get passed around all over          the office.  Yeah, like I'm going to risk my job with the New York Yankees          to make a few extra bucks. (winks)  Is that the lovely Mrs. Morgan?   Birthday card?  Oh ah, I uh, will have that for you by after lunch.  Of course. Your massage. (winks) Enjoy your massage. (winks)  Hey, Mr. Morgan how was your massage?  Really?  Hey, listen don't oversleep. You can't afford to be late again.  Geez, Hey you know something, you should try my friend's wake          up service. She swears by this thing.  Ah, not yet.   Yes sir!  You got the Yankee envelope?  oh,   Hey, he,   What is this?  Who told you to sell the card?  No I didn't!   I was not winking you idiot. That was the grapefruit. It's like          acid. I need that card back. It's Mr. Steinbrenner's. I was responsible.  Well get it back! It's very important. (winks)  (holds eyes wide open) Get it back!  He's not here?  It's impossible. I got him a wake up service.  . . . gone?  I don't want Morgan's job. He's got a lot of work to do. Hey,          Elaine, your friend never woke up Mr. Morgan.  Napkins?  What exactly is mutton?  No, that's right, I didn't. I take full responsibility for the          card not being here. I, uh, . . .   You wanted to see me, Mr. Steinbrenner?  Oh, no, not just me, the whole organization. Especially Mr. Morgan.          Oh no, Morgan is a good man sir.  Wa, uh, thank you sir, you know I am not quite sure I'm right          for it.  I know.  I know.  That's what I'm afraid of. You know Mr. Steinbrenner, . . .   Well a lot of people consider me small and prestigious.  I enjoy understanding.  I want you to have this job. Of course...  That's it.  He never finished the sentence. He got a call, that was                the end of the interview.  Maybe he was going to say "Of course I have to check                with my associates."  All right.  Because he made a big deal about how I understand everything                immediately. That's what  And if I don't call...  Rest stop supply.  I had a job interview.  Good. Of course...  He massacred you. You look like you're five years old.  You've got to start seeing someone else. Get out of this                relationship.  You gotta do it.  So I still haven't heard about that job.  I have an idea.  I show up.  I show up. I pretend I have the job. The guy's on vacation.                If I have the job, it's fine. If I don't  What's the worst thing that could happen?  Yeah, so?  (to various people as he walks in) Good morning. Good morning.                Good morning. Hi nice to see  The name's George Constanza. I'm starting work here today.                I was wondering if you could tell  Thanks Mike. Nice to be aboard.  Oh, well, he was probably just getting anxious to start                his vacation.  Oh leave Jack alone. Jack's got enough problems. I'll just                take the small office.  Yes. I like to feel cozy. I have a very small apartment.                I like to feel tucked in, nestled in. Love  Yes, yes of course. The Pensky file. Ho ho, can't wait                to sink my teeth into that. Wow that   They gave me the Pensky file.  You know I'm enjoying it very much. I think my coworkers                are really taking to me.   (continuing) I feel like a family. In fact, yesterday was                Grace's birthday. She's such a sweet   He'll be back on Monday.  You know Elaine, I'd do it but I'm working that day.  Mr. Pensky? Of the Pensky file?  Mr. Pensky. I was just working on your file. I was transferring                the contents of the file into this  He's on vacation.  Well you know in college they used to call me the little                bulldog.  Really?  Not now Florice.  I am aware. I am aware.  Mr. Tuttle, you're back.  You are?  Oh. Really.  Well you missed a lovely little party that we had for Grace.  Well bear in mind that I am in the smaller office.  You are aware that Pensky is interested in me.  Well, we'll just see about that. Ta-ta, Tut-tle.  Obviously.  So, Marcy, you should've seen me in the hot tub yoday.  I was naked.  Really? What happened?  Is "yada yada" bad?  She is succinct.  Hey.  Yeah, dentist of the stars.  Hey, where you just at the health club?  What a succinct story.  Oh, it's not mine. It's my mother's.  Well, they gave birth to me, and, yada yada...  Yada yada yada...  Oh, you're in here.  I knew you had an appointment.  I'll leave when the guy comes in. I gotta tell you, I am                loving this yada yada thing. You know, I can cross over my whole                life story. (Picks up dental tool)  Hey, what this thing? Whew!  Hey, Tim. Quick question. Is it normal for your teeth to                make noises, like a hissing or a chirping?  Fine, I'll make an appointment. (He leaves)  Well, we were engaged to be married, uh, we bought the                wedding invitations, and, uh, yada yada yada, I'm still single.  Yada.  Listen to this. Marcy comes up and she tells me her ex-boyfriend                was over late last night, and "yada yada yada, I'm really tired                today." You don't think she yada yada'd sex.  Really?  Well, I gotta do somethin'. (Walks over to bathroom. Kramer                enters)  Well it was a helluva yada yada.  All right, enough! Enough! From now on, no more yada yada's.                Just give me the full story.  Tell me about the free facial.  Which one?  Very good. Go on.  What's that?  Shoplifting.  Jerry, I gotta talk to you.  She, uh, went shopping for some shoes for the wedding and,                yada yada yada, I'll see her in six to eight months. (Kramer and                Julie enter)  I can't believe this!  How can I do this?! How can I move back in with those people?                Please, tell me! They're insane! You know that.  How can you compare you parents to my parents?!  My father wears his sneakers in the pool! Sneakers!  (Showing Jerry up) Listen carefully. My mother has never                laughed. Ever. Not a giggle, not a chuckle, not a tee-hee.. never                went 'Ha!'  Maybe!.. And I'm moving back in there!  No, no, no, no. Borrowing money from a friend is like having                sex. It just completely changes the relationship.  I don't want to! I'm outta money! I got 714 dollars left                in the bank.  (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna move in with him. He                doesn't even let you use the toilet!  (Sincerely) Thank you.. I, uh.. that might not work out.  (Annoyed) There's more.  Bologna?! No one eats bologna anymore!  (Muttering) No, that's it.  (Runs over to him, not wanting him to leave) What? You're                going?  Wha - what are you doing later?  Really?  Yeah.. may - maybe I'll meet ya?  (Mutters) Oh.. okay.. talk to you later.  Oh, my God.. (Buries his face into his hands)  (Studying the salt shaker) I'm not taking a civil service                test.  Yes, I've seen a silver dollar.  To do what?! Work in a post office? Is that what you want                me to do?  I'm a college graduate. You want me to be a mailman?  I don't know. I do know that I have some kind of a talent                - something to offer. I just don't know what it is yet!  (Looks fed up with his parents) Oh my God..  (Needing to get away from his parents, he gets up) I need                some air..  (Walks off) I got a lot of thinking to do.  Oh, I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.. (Bends down, and starts                picking up her things)  (Stuttering) I, I, I, .. here, let me - let me help you..  It - it's just that I'm here with my parents, and my mother                wants me to take a civil service test - and to tell you the truth,                I don't even think I'd pass it.. So..  What?  What about them?  They are?  Hand modeling? (Shakes his head 'No')  Me neither!  I don't know.  This woman just set me up for a job!  What, are you kidding? (Points at the flaws of Jerry's                hands) The knuckles are all out of proportion. you got hair over                there - where do you get off  This is it! It happened to me, Jerry! I was sitting in                the restaurant, the two nut jobs were talking - I couldn't take                it any more. I got up, and (Makes a  What are you, crazy?! What are you, crazy?!  You coulda damaged my hand!  (Defensively) You can look at them, but do NOT touch them.                (Holds them out. Kramer studies them)  (Takes two oven mitts from his back pack) Alright, (puts                them on) I gotta get going.  (Embarrassed) That's all I could find. (A moment passes)                Would you mind getting the door?  Thank you very much. (Walks out)  (Snaps, then points to the coffee table) Hand me an Emory                board.  (To Estelle) Scissor. (She gets the scissors from the coffee                table and hands them to George) Don't hand them to me with the point                facing out!   You're sorry?!  (Stern, angered) I hope so. (Takes the scissors)  Alright! Please, please! I cannot have this constant bickering!..                Stress is very damaging to the epidermis! Now, I have an important                photo session in the  (Definite) I'll take it in my room. (Walks off)  Who was he?  (Hands still out, even though they've stopped looking at                them) What happened to him?  You mean, uh..?  (Makes a gesture saying he understands. The man nods) But                how.. uh..?  (Smiling to himself) You don't have to worry about me.                (Nodding, gloating) I won a contest.  Why are            two pretending to be laughing?  Oh, real            good. (George makes a face like: you stink) Any word from NBC?  I don't            understand. They're supposed to be casting this week. Something's wrong.            Maybe they're not doing it.  Out of            the question.  (to Jerry)            How could we not hear anything? What's with this Russel? What's he doing?            (Jerry raises his arms and shoulders like: he doesn't know)  He's getting            phone calls here now? (he's standing near the counter and eating chips            out of a big bag)  What?            I'm comfortable.  What if            the pilot gets picked up and it becomes a series?  Yeah,            that's exactly what I'm worried about. God would never let me be successful.            He'd kill me first. He'd never let me be happy.  I do for            the bad things.  What?  (gets            up and picks a mirror) Yes. Yes, it's white. Why it's white.  Better            get that checked out?  What kind            of a therapist are you? I'm telling I'm scared that something terrible            is gonna happen to me, right away you start looking for tumors?  What are            you like a sadist? No matter how bad somebody feels, you can make 'em            feel worse. I bet you're rooting for a tumor. (pointing to her)  Oh I'm            going baby! I'm going! (he leaves)  Right            here. (showing his lip)  (to the            cab driver) Excuse me, do you see anything on my lip here?  Oh, my            God.  (to Jerry)            It's all white Jerry! It's all white!  Again            with the checked out. I'm not going to the doctor. If I don't to the            doctor, then nothing will happen to me. If I go he might find something.  Catch            what in time?  You think            it's something?  (to Jay)            What do you think it is?  Yeah.            So what's going on? We're gonna shoot the pilot and then it's gonna            be on TV the following week?  (thinking)            This guy's perfect.  No, not            a loser!  Thank            you! Thank you very much. (Jerry and Melissa stop and look at George)  Very nice  Very nice            Tom, that was terrific.  Sure.            Thank you for coming in. (Tom eats some raisins)  Yeah.            Really.  Take care.            Take it easy. (Tom leaves with the casting director)  What happened            to the raisins?  Did he            just steal the raisins?  You see,            It's right here. It's all white...  You've            never seen this before?  (dramatically)            A what?  A biopsy?  Cancer?            Is it cancer? Do I have cancer?  A biopsy!  He said            he didn't know what it was.  When I            asked him if it was cancer, he didn't give me a "get outta here". That's            what I wanted to hear: "Cancer? Get outta here?"  How could            you be a doctor and not say "get outta here"? It should be part of the            training at medical school: "Cancer? Get outta here!" "Go home! What            are you crazy? It's a little test. It's nothing. You're a real nut.            You know that?" (Jerry gives him half of his sandwich to hopefully shut            him up) I told you that God would never let me be successful. I never            should've written that pilot. Now the show will be a big hit, we'll            make millions of dollars, and I'll be dead. Dead Jerry. Because of this.            (showing his lip)  No I can't.            I can't die with dignity. I have no dignity. I want to be the one person            who doesn't die with dignity. I live my whole life in shame. Why should            I die with dignity?  You got            mugged?  Elaine.  (to Jerry)            Have you seen the waitresses in there lately? I never had so much coffee            in my life.  Apply            for a job? What for?  It's a            coincidence.  Oh, what's the point? When I like them, they don't like                me, when  Maybe I need someone who doesn't speak English.  A mute would be good.  This is what my life has come to... Tryin to meet a mute.  I dunno, Jerry somethin's missing. There's a void, Jerry,  There's gotta be more to life than this. What gives you                pleasure?  Start what?  *Really*.  Volunteer work, huh?  When did you get this idea?  And... and anybody can do this?  Helping people... Of course. Of course! It makes perfect                sense!  What *kind* of a person are you?  Well, I feel better already. I'm feelin' like a good person.  Hey, what's your guy's name again?  Ben Cantwell. 85. Huh... You think we'll make it to that                age?  Let me ask you something. What do you do for a living,                Newman?  Aren't those the guys that always go crazy and come back                with a  Y'know the average life span for an American male is like,                72.  You don't? Boy, I think about it a lot. I think about it                at my  Grateful? How can you be grateful when you're *so* close                to the  What are you talking about? How can you sit there and look                me in  Wait a second, where are you going?  Wait a minute, please--  But Mr. Cantwell, you... you owe me for the soup...  I don't think it's gonna work out...  He fired me.  I dunno. I was just talking to the man and he walked out                on me!  Yeah, I'm a great quitter. It's one of the few things I                do well.  Senegal?  So you don't speak *any* English at all?  You don't speak *any* English?  I would like to dip my bald head in oil and rub it all                over  I thought I saw something fly over here...  Hey!  That's cute.  No , never mind.  Maybe it's got something to do with that 42 in the corner                .  Well , I can't crack this one.  try shaking it...(long pause) Well ,Janet should be here                any minute.  Aah! the minute I saw this girl , we just clicked. She's                got such a nice face. hummmm her eyes, her  Hey! George and Janet.  Kramer , what are you talking about...Janet doesn't look                anything like Jerry  No..hummm , What do you know about what you look like.  Well,,, it's getting dark.  What does that mean?  (to Jerry) What do you mean by that?  Oh! I know....'Cos you don't think Janet?..  Why would I...  Yes.  No...  Exactly.  ...neither am I.  Where's the crazy man , Come on up.  Haaaaaa!!!  Don't leave (George slams the door)  What's the decision?  Silence YES!!  (frantic by now) SHUT UP ,SHUT UP , SHUT UP,...(then leaves)  (we hear him think) My friends are idiots , she doesn't                look like Jerry. She doesn't look like anybody.  I know....  You know , you know what's great about our relationship?...It's                not about looks.  ....But after that we really talked didn't we?  Na....no ... This relationship he..he..has got to be about                something and fast or I'm in very   Aw right YES! GUM! Good enough I'll take it.  I do too. you see that's what we're about . You don't remind                me of anyone and we love gum.  I'm losin' it  OK Look , the gum isn't cutting it for me. We need to be                about something else...anything..please.  Your hair?  George is in big trouble....  like that ( looking at Jerry)  Yes..  Nooo...  Exactly..  We...must never ever speak of this again..  Actually I think I'm gonna take a few days off ( starts                to leave)  Oh, boy I was up to four in the morning watching the Omen trilogy.  I can't to myself. I'm exhausted.  Not with that big glass window looking out into the hall. I'd          love a good nap. That's the only thing getting me out of bed in the morning.          I'll see ya'.  Jerry, look at my eyes.  Because I'm REFRESHED. I finally found a way to sleep in my office.          Under the desk. I lie on my back. I tuck in the chair. I'm invisible.          Conrad, is it?  Uh, let me ask you a question. Could you, uh, expand the space          underneath a desk to give it a little more headroom?  It'll have to be a night job anyway. You don't normally work          after dinner, do you?  Do you think it might be possible to add a little shelf like,          uh, for an alarm clock?  Like this.  Thanks. You know this could sound crazy but, what do you think          about adding a drawer for - like a blanket?  Blanket.  Maybe like this.  Yeah, like that.  That is what I want.  Whatever!!. . . . Oh oh oh this is unbelievable. This is better          than my bed at home.  Its been a long night. You go home and get some sleep.   That's what I want.  Good morning Mr. Wilhelm.  Jerry, I'm trapped under my desk. Steinbrenner is in the room.          You got to help[ me.  Jerry, . . .   Sh, sh, goodbye, sh, get away.  ?? get away??  Can't you think of something. Call in a bomb threat.  Just CALL!  I'm sorry sir.  What?  Well, you really did it to me this time, Seinfeld. . . . What          the hell happened here?  Hi. Look at how obtrusive this is.  Fitted Hat Day! That's what you asked Steinbrenner for?  Guess who he put in charge of Fitted Hat Day? Me.  Yeah, look at me. Now I GOTTA FIGURE OUT THE HAT SIZES OF 59,000          DIFFERENT PEOPLE!! WHAT IF A PINHEAD SHOWS UP. I GOTTA BE ON TOP OF THAT.  ??? KNOCK OFFS. I NOT GOING TO DO IT! AND YOU'RE GOING TO CALL          STEINBRENNER BACK AND CANCEL THE WHOLE THING.  FINE? WHAT SIZE?  SEVEN AND FIVE EIGHTHS!!  I DON'T KNOW. It's this place. I'm very uncomfortable here.  Sir, I just got a call from the terrorist. I told him to call          back here.  Let me put that on speaker phone.  Good thinking, sir.  You have to stand tough sir. That's why I had to hang up the          phone.  Lunch.  Sir, I'm sure it's not a police matter.  Hi Connie, Jerry around?  There was something so reassuring about that cozy little space.  She can't kill me right?!  People break up all the time.  It just didn't work out. What can I do? I wanted to love                her. I tried to love her. I couldn't.  I kept looking at her face. I'd go: "C'mon, love her.                Love her!"  Oh, I had no choice. She squeezed it out of me! She'd tell                me she loved me. Alright, at first, I just look at her. I'd go "Oh,                really?" or "Boy, that's, that's  And I didn't even ask her out. She asked me out first.                She called me up. What was I supposed to do? Say no? I can't do                that to someone.  I am. I'm a nice guy.. (realizing) And she seduced me!                We were in my apartment, I'm sitting on the couch, she's on the                chair - I get up to go to the  I had nothing to do wtih any of this! I met all her friends,                I didn't want to meet them. I kept trying to avoid it. I knew it                would only get me in deeper. But  My back is killing me.  Oh yeah, everybody's guy is the best.  Please. They don't do anything.. Look, do I have to break                up with her in person? CAn't I do it over the phone? I have no stomach                for these things.  I'm letting you in.  No, you won't.  Okay..  Please, it doesn't look good. Boy, boy, girl.  Is it that obvious?  (imitating Tony Bennett) "You know, I'd go from nods                to nothing.."  I think you absolutely have to say something to this guy.                Confront him.  Yes.  If I was a different person.  I'm outta there. I did it! It's over.  I told her. In the kitchen - which was risky 'cause it's                near all the knives. I started with the word "Listen."  I said, "Listen Marlene," and then the next thing                I know, I'm in the middle of it. And there's this voice inside of                me going: "You're doing it! You're doing  No, I, I don't think so.  Oh no, thank you.  No, really. No, no, thanks.  Except for one small problem. I left some books in her                apartment.  Oh, no. No, I can't go back there. Jerry, it's so awkward                and, you know, it could be dangerous - sexually. Something could                happen, I'd be right back  Well, yeah.  I don't know. They're books.  They're MY books.  Jerry, it's not my fault.  That's standard. Has she left you one of those messages                where she uses up the whole machine?  What about getting off the phone?  Just do it like a Band-Aid. One motion, right off! She                is sexy though. Don't you think?  Yeah.  (To Jerry, sarcastically) Yeah, doctor. I'm going to have                to wait in that little room by myself, aren't I? (Picks up a crossword                puzzle) I better take this. I  I was in there for two minutes. He didn't do anything.                (Imitating doctor) Touch this, feel that. Seventy-five bucks.  What's seventy-five bucks? What, am I seeing Sinatra in                there?! Amd I being entertained? I don't understand this. I'm only                paying half.  Why not?  Oh, no, no, no. I pay what I say.  I don't care.  No, I don't care.  Absolutely.  No.  I don't know. But I don't. I'm actually almost happy to                hear it.  I guess I should be but I'm not.  No, you're a fine person. You're a humanitarian. She's                very sexy.  I know, I know.  See her tonight. See her tomarrow. Go. Knock yourself out.                She's too crazy for me.  I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I never felt better                in my whole life.  (Angry) You paid that crook?!  He didn't do anything, Jerry. It's a scam! Who told you                to do that?  I was trying to make a point.  (Gasping) I think I swallowed a fly! ..I swallowed a fly!                What do I do? What can happen?  What's wrong with him?   Well, I'm sure you'll find something.   What are those?   Wow, just felt your material?   Sounds like a cool guy.   Jerry, where did you get that sweater?   I think that's what the back of closets are for.   Who's that?   I don't know how you can let this guy handle all your money.                Yes, I saw that.   He was definitely sniffing.   All right, I've got to get going. My parents are expecting                me.   This is my ketchup. I bought this ketchup just so I could                have as much as I want.   Next Friday, what time?   That's my whole afternoon! I was going to look for sneakers.                I know a little. Besides, what do you have to know?   Do we have to...?   They are made from lycra-spandex.   She doesn't want to get a bra.   All right, it wouldn't kill me.   I-I know about the cups.   I know the D is the biggest. I've based my whole life on                knowing that the D is the biggest.   I got it. Cups in the front, loops in the back.   Well, that interests me very much Mr. Farkus.Very much                indeed, sir.   No, but I have very good repute with women, very good,                top form. And the first time I laid my I on brassieres I was enthralled.                Well, I was 14 years old. I was in my friends bathroom.                His mother's brassieres were hanging on the shower rod. I picked                it up, studied it. I thought, I like this. I didn't know what way                or what level, but I knew: I wanted to be around brassieres.   They are more than an underwear to me Mr.Farkus. Two cups                in the front, two loops in the back. How do they do it?   Thank you Mr.Farkus, thank you very much indeed.   If you don't mind, sir. I'll be here at 8.   So long, Mr. Farkus.   Oh, nothing...   So what, what is so bad about that?   You know, I've been thinking.. I cannot envision any circumstances                in which I'll ever have the opportunity to have sex again. How's                it gonna happen? I  They always make me take stock of my life and how I've                pretty much wasted all of it, and how I plan to continue wasting                it.  You know, I can't believe you're even considering not playing.                We need you. You're hitting everything.  (To Jerry) Who's going to play left field?  Bender? He can't play left. He stinks. I just don't see                what purpose is it going to serve your going? I mean, you think                dead peole care who's at the  If you're a spirit, and you can travel to other dimensions                and galaxies, and find out the mysteries of the universe, you think                she's going to want to hang  You know how easy it is for dead people to travel? It's                not like getting on a bus. One second. It's all mental.  Who gets picked off in softball? It's unheard of.  And they in the fifth inning, why did you take off on the                pop fly?  What about Sharon Besser?  Maybe Manya missed the funeral because she was off visiting                another galaxy that day.  Not necessarily. (Elaine laughs)  Hey.  Really?  I've done the march in. Best feeling in the world.  Not as good. That's when you realize all the money you're                losing.  Jerry, I need to borrow your camera.  Well, I wanna put a picture of me and my boss Mr. Morgan                up at the office.  They're reorganizing the staff, and I'm on thin ice with                this guy as it is.   It better be.  (Holding camera) Look at this, I only have one picture                left... How 'bout a shot of me and Mr. Morgan?  Why? Because we're a team! C'mon! Would you take this for                us, dear? Thank you very much. Here we go... (To Morgan) Anyone                ever tell you you look a lot like Sugar Ray Leonard? Yeah, you must                get that all the time.  No, not a racial thing, there really is a resemblance...                A little? Come on.  You think Morgan thinks I have a racial bias?  Boy, that is so unfair. I would've marched on Selma if it was  Absolutely. I still might. I always hated those girls. They  For what?  Hey, Kramer. Who does that look like?  Come on, come on. Not salt, but...?  No. Sugar Ray Leonard.  All right, I'll tell you what. I'll bet you the next three people I  You know what would be great? If he could see me with  Hello, Joe?  It's me. George Costanza.  Remember I was here a while back? Breakfast at Tiffany's  Well, I've rented another video, Joe. And there's some  Remy. Hi.  Well, I got another Audrey Hepburn movie.  You know, Remy, I was thinking. Last time we were  How ya doin'?  Nice day today.  I'm George. George Costanza, you live around here?  Yo.  Hey, Jerry, how was Ithaca?  Hey, Jerry, what was the name of the exterminator who fumigated                your apartment when you had fleas?  Carl... Yeah, he was a nice guy.  What company was it?  Yeah, you know we spoke for a little bit...  No, not really.  Gotta go.  May I help you?  Oh, yes of course, come in.  Yes, well, if the other people in the office saw that I                called an exterminator, they would just panic. Besides, this is                sort of a friendly visit. Carl, right?  Yeah, sure, we met at Jerry Seinfeld's apartment. When                you fumigated for fleas over there.  Jerry? Yes, I suppose he is white. You know, I never really                thought about it. I don't see people in terms of color. You know,                there's someone I'd like you to meet. Hand on... (To phone) Is Mr.                Morgan in?  He left... huh... Carl, you hungry?  (To Carl) Oh, by the way, order anything you want, it's                all on me. Just do me a tiny favor: pretend we're old friends. Oh                my God! Mr. Morgan! What a coincidence, it's Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan,                I want you to meet a dear old friend of mine, Carl.  That's... what we used to call him in high school, the                exterminator. He's a linebacker. Oh, did we have some wild times.  I love this place. You know, Carl and I come here all the                time.  Check, please.  Mr. Morgan! Did you hear that? Mr. Morgan!  Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?  When are they leaving for Paris?  What about her place?  Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a          cool thing, living with your parents.  Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come,          who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to          be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?  Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over          dinner before they leave town.  Hey Alec  Hey Joey, how you doin'?  Well uh....  Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.  What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?  Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now          they do it right after single Jeopardy.  Oh, n-no comparison.  (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.  Your parents are going to Paris right?  So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined          amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have          your parents mail them from Paris.  Who?  I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you          get to Paris (handing Morty the   Well no not yet, you gotta buy french   Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in          the attic, y-you think they're worth something?  What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in          the clothing in then?  (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.  (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents          really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What          about tonight?   Yea they're making Payaya.  Well um, what about tomorrow night?  Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.  (quietly) Ya.  Ya.  No, they had plans.  That's what I wanna know.  They said tomorrow, maybe.  I don't know what the reason could be.  Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for          Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.  Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's          a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be          away for.  An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said          uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.  Fantastic?  How gee what a coincidence.  I dunno they said maybe.  Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.   I-I wasn't in the attic.  Maybe it was a mouse.  What?  You haven't even seen one.  (Pays his bill) Thanks, see ya later, Donna. (Walks out,                he runs into Jerry outside the shop) What happened to you?  What? What did you do?  What did you do?  Done what?  Elaine's moving into your building?  Right above you?  You're gonna be neighbors.  She's right above you?  How could you do that?  Don't insult me, my friend. Remember who you're talking                to. No one's a bigger idiot than me.  Did you ever go to a singles weekend in the Poconos?  You're doomed. You're gonna have to have all your sex at                women's apartments. It'll be like a permanent road trip. Forget    Of course, we all do.  I was just in there. It's embarrassing.  They saw me walk out.  My censor quit two years ago. He checked into a clinic.                Emotionally exhausted.  Tough.  I don't think anyone's turned down an apartment because                of a weak shower spray.  For that rent, she'd take a bath in the toilet tank if                she had to..  I'd like to have a kid. Of course, you have to have a date                first.. remember my friend, Adam, from Detroit?  He's a cube.. anyway, he got married six months ago. he                told me ever since he's been wearing a wedding band, women have                been coming on to him  (Joking) I wonder if that's really true.  Thanks a lot. I"ll give it back to you in a week.  I'm not doing that.  No, I'll put half a can of mousse in my head like you.  What happened to you?  Five thousand dollars? She doesn't have five thousand dollars!  So, she can't get the apartment.  So, she doesn't move in.  And how does the baldness fit into that plan?  Are you kidding?! I lie ever second of the day. My whole                life is a sham!  Of course you do.  (Showing off his wedding band) Yeah, my wife couldn't make                it today. She's got some thing with her mother.. Who know's what                going on with her. Don't  ..Yeah, my wife started getting on me about the lawn today.                I'm tellin' ya, it's one thing after another.  No, she's working.  She's an.. entymologist - you know, bees, flies, gnats.                What about you?  But.. (She leaves, George is standing there)  I'm sorry, I don't see the big deal about being a matador.                The bull charges, you move the cape, wha't so hard? (The both laugh                flirtingly)  You'd have to be a real loser to try something like that.  (Frantically tries to take the ring off) I'm not. It's                just a sociological experiment!  Is that right? (Showing him up) I just threw away a lifetime                of guilt-free sex and floor seats for ever sporting event in Madison                Square Garden. So please,  But suddenly, a new contender has emerged..  I gotta get out of this city.  I'm at the health club and while I'm in the pool, some guy walks off                  with my glasses. Who steals prescription glasses?  I broke 'em playing basketball.  Now if I wanna see anything I gotta wear these.  When I find that guy, this much I vow: those glasses will be returned                  to their rightful owner.   What kind of a sick, demented person wants another person's glasses?  Yeah, come on.  Really?  Wow. What do I have to do?  That's it?  What about these?  It's a tough decision. I have to wear these every day. I'm deciding                  on a new face.  Yes, they are bold. Jerry, what do you think?  Can you believe that guy?  He just walked away! And once again I'm standing here like a little                  man. Well not this time!  You! Dog man!  Uuh, no.   (In a really strange way:) Good, good, do that.  Oh, no, nothing.   I can't tell you.  I can't tell you, don't ask.  I saw Amy making out with your cousin Jeffrey.   They were right outside!  Yes!  Yes, positive.  I know! I was squinting.  (To the store owner:) Excuse me, what do you think of these?  Yes, it is exciting! All right, this is gonna be my new face.  Yeah.  Kramer...  Kramer...  You do know Kramer?  Well, I'm mentioning his name.  Because... you know...   Hey, I saw what I saw.  What side?  Ooh, so what?  Why don't you just ask Jeffrey?  There must be some way to find out.  What, you're gonna take her word over mine? I'm your best friend!  I was squinting! Remember that drive from Wortsborough? I was spotting                  those raccoons.   Hey look, a dime.   Mercury head. You mind?  Did you get the shot?  You got bit by a strange dog and you didn't get a rabies shot?  Pardon me, I went to see your friend Dwayne... there was no discount.   That's right, no discount!  Yes, I mentioned your name.  Bubkis!  All right, let me just... I'm gonna grap an apple.  Yes it is.  I saw them making out, you can believe it.  You'll see I'm right.  Elaine, don't interrupt, they're discounting something.  I did!  Well Elaine was supposed to help me.  That's it? You don't have to screw it in or anything?  Oh yeah, when are you gonna execute that plead?  Madame? What are you calling me madam for?  He sold me ladies' glasses!  Oh boy.  Oh uuh, sure, hang on. Hey, that's the guy.  The guy that stole my glasses. This time I got 'em!  Would you pick it up a little?  He's getting on a bus, damn! (To the blind man:) Those are nice glasses.  Is that really?  Dwayne, my friend and I would like to exchange frames. Could you put                  his lenses in my frames and mine in his?  And I'd like a discount.   Listen, you're lucking I'm not asking for a refund. You gave me ladies'                  frames!   Yeah, well, she's trying to track you down.  No, that's Jerry.  Yeah, 5A!  Wait, these really do pinch the nose.  Oh my got it is them.  Yeah. Boy these really do pinch. I tell you, if I ever find the son                  of a bitch that stole my glasses...  What is Holland?  No, that's the Netherlands.  Then who are the Dutch?  I know, I hate it too. I feel like an out of work porn                star.  Well why didn't we?  What if we grew muttonchops?  Buzz cuts? Parachute pants!  Hey hey hey, check me out, huh?  Yeah, with crutches everyone has questions.  Nah, with crutches it's a funny story, with a cane it's                a sad story.   Alright, we're back in!  Killed.  And you're the shark?  I don't know how a fish could eat laughs.  Oh my god.  I got a job interview. They want to see me this afternoon.  Oh, it's beautiful. It's in sports.  Playground equipment.  I got the job?  Handicap? (gesturing to his cane) I'm not handicapped.  Yeah, I didn't mean that.  When do I start?  Yeah, what the hell.  Jerry, it's fantastic. I love the people over there. They                treat me so  Yeah, yeah, well, because of the cane. You should see the                bathroom  Jerry, let's face it, I've always been handicapped. I'm                just now  Alright I made up the part about the car, but the rest                is true. He  I love that bathroom. It's got that high, high toilet.                I feel like a  What's with all the butter?  Who?  You miss her, don't you?  You miss her.  No, I fake limp on my right. This is a real limp because                I sprained my  Well, I was buttering myself up for a nice shave --  I must have dripped some on the floor and I slipped and...  So what, he's got a couple of good jokes.  That's true, that always happens to me.  I don't know, I like stuff you don't have to think about                too much.  maybe I am.  Puke! That's a funny word. Puke. (laughing) puke! Don't                have to  Oh, no, that's just the old handicap acting up.  That's just because we're standing on opposite sides. See,                when we  See? This looks right to you, doesn't it?  Well, you're not gonna believe what happened.  Play Now thinks I got problems in both legs. My own personal                Rascal,  How's the trip?  Ah, you still going on in front of Bania, eh?  What are you talking about? You're not!  You're throwing the set?  Listen Jerry. Bania's voice is the voice of a new generation.                My  nevertheless. His time has come.  Now if you will kindly help me unwedge my front wheel,                I'll be on my  Whatcha got there, the 4 volt? Heh, I did you a favor.  Oh yeah?  Are you a religious man, sir?  I had to say something. I had to say something.                Everything was going so well; I had to say something.  I told her I liked her. Why? Why did I tell                her I like her? I have this sick compulsion to tell women how I                feel. I like you I don't tell you.  I'm outta the picture. I am outta the picture.                (laughs) It's only a matter of time now.  Oh no. No, no, no, no.  We were in the lobby during the intermission                of the play. I was buying her one of those containers of orange                drink, for five dollars. I reached into my  Of course. So, I'm looking at it, I look up,                I see she's looking at it. Our eyes lock. It was a horrible moment.                I just..  If I didn't put that floss in my pocket, I'd                be crawling around her bedroom right now looking for my glasses.  Yes, I am.  What? You don't like this?  What do you mean Wednesday? I though we had                tickets to the Knick game Wednesday. We got seats behind the bench!                What happened? We're not  Oh. Who is this guy?  I don't know why you even bother with this                ping pong guy, I'll tell you that.  I don't understand why you spend time with                this guy.  No, no, no,no you have to approach this as                if he was a woman.  Absolutely. You just tell him the truth.  ..she calls me up at my office, she says,                "We have to talk."  That, or "Who's bra is this?"  So we order lunch, and we're talking. Finally,                she blurts out how it's "not working".  So, I'm thinking, as she's saying this, I'm                thinking: great, the relationship's over. But the egg salad's on                the way. So now I have a decision - do I walk or  We sat there for twenty minutes, chewing,                staring at each other in a defunct relationship.  Have you ever had their egg salad?  It's unbelievable. You know what else is unbelievable?                I picked up the check. She didn't even offer. She ended it. The                least she could do is send me off  (sarcastic) That's funny. You're a funny guy.  Ewing's hurt? How long is he going to be out?  Geez.  I got scared there for a second. The Knicks                without Ewing.  What about it?  What?  You what?!  No! My ticket?! You gave my ticket to Horneck?  Why did you give him my ticket for?  Oh, please. (to the teller) Can you change                this into bills?  I'm not going with him. I don't even know                the guy. (to the teller) Look, they did this for me before.  You want me to roll six thousand of these?!                What, should I quit my job?!  ..Thirty-two, thirty-three-  (raises his hand) Not now.. (counts to himself).  Nnnnnnnninngaaa! (Dumping out roll) What?!  Oh, yeah, sure. Keep your money.  (pantomimes sticking an imaginary knife in                his heart, and twists it) Oh geeeee.. Go, go!  He was really crying?  Wait a minute. Wait a minute. As long as you're                going to lie to the guy, why don't you tell him that you lost both                of the tickets, then we could go?  This is the thing where you go and you have                to make your own pizza?  Oh, well.  My money's all tied up in change right now.  Trapezoid?  Ive                had my difficulties.   Mr. Thomassoulo                during times of great stress, people are capable of super human                strength. Have you ever seen the Incredible Hulk, sir?  How about                the old Spider Man live action show?  I dont                understand.  Clearer  Why not?                Pay is good. I got dental, private access to one of the great handicapped                toilets in the city.  Theyre                the ones who should be ashamed. They signed me to a one-year contract.                As long as I show up for work every day, they have to pay me.  Hello-o-o-o                Elaine!  (doing                the voice) Not at all.  Thats                beautiful.  Witness.  Percentage?  Good Morning!  Hi Allison,                thats a nice dress.  Hey Glenn!  Heard                that one already.  (doing                the voice) Hello-o-o-o. (Hes sitting on the floor in his Play                Now office).    Siege mentality   Jerry. They really want me out of here. Theyve                downgraded me to some sort of a bunker. Im like Hitlers             last days here.  Oh no!                Im vigilant. Theyll never get me out. Im like                a weed, Jerry.  Im                a weed in Hitlers bunker.  Well,                Play Now is through playing. They turned the heat way up in my office.                They tried to sweat me out.  I dont                know, 120, 130Then they sent some guys to sandblast for 6                hours. Tomorrow they are putting in asbestos.   Bring                it on!  (doing    (doing                the voice) La la la.  (Interrupts)                And I still say hes naked under there!  Oh, shut                up!  (whistling).(laughing).AlrightOK.  (on phone                 calling secretary) Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are                you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message                for me? Yes. If he needs me, tell him (screams) IM IN                MY OFFICE! Thanks.  You broke                up with her? Why?  I think                Im getting tired of it. I mean is that all it does? Hello?                La-la-la?  I think                I like the girl better than the voice.  I told                you.  (talking                from bathroom) Witness?  I think                Play Now is putting something in my food.  I told                you.  You see                if I stay the whole year, I get it all.  Well played.  You have                to drink that whole thing?  Would                a giant rubber ball work?  Well,                Play Now has all kinds of different rubber balls. Why dont                we test your bladder system at my office?  Oh, yes                I am. Mr. Thomassoulo likes to play dirty. Well, theres nothing                dirtier than a giant ball of oil.  (again                from bathroom) Witness.  Oh, you                might want to stick around Jerry. Mr. Thomassoulo picked the wrong                man to hire because he was fake handicapped.  Hey, use                mine. Ill let you in.  I uh,                took care of that.  I insist.                Ill fix us a drink. (phone rings  who would that be?)                I got it.  So, check                out my view.  Hey, theres                Kramer & Darren.  Hello.  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  (doing                the voice) Im slippery as an eel  I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would         that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for         you?"  Do ya?  Same thing!  Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?  Nah - what for?  I've been to the movies.  They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of         it.  Yeah.  When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my         15 minutes!  Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it         for me anymore. I'm sick  Oh, very gracious.  Yeah.  What are you crazy?  Big hefty stinking faux pas.  On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.  It's dismissive.  Why don't you think before you do something?  Too much?  Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should         know better than that.  What?  You're so uptight.  Who's he?  Our show, "Jerry"?  "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?  When?   Right now? "Jerry"?  He wants to talk about "Jerry"?  "Jerry"!  Can I go like this?  No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.  I won't feel like a writer.  Right!  Water. Need some water! Water here!  Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.  I will not blow this.  It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.  Something, nothing, I could care less.  Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm         down!  Magic time.  Hey, hey, hey!  Hello Stu.  Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?  Kimbrough.  K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H  It's a talent I have.  Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -         it's crispy crisp.  What do we have in the fruit department?  Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the         end. You can get killed from   Been there, done that.  Water coolers?  See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.  It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use         bottles.  I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show         is all about.  Or we could get them together. Woo!  Yeah!  I'm moving to California.  Of course he liked it.  He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.  I'm writing.  Ma?!  I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.  So? Where are we going?  If you're bleak, you're bleak.  It's a bit hilly - no?  What if I want to walk around a little?  What if I'm at the bottom?  Me too.  This is it?  I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a         lot nicer.  You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?  Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.  This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a         good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.  Why?  It's effeminate to sit like this?   How is this effeminate?  Kramer, what are you doing?  Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.  Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.  Kramer!  Oh my God!  I told you to stop with the hopping.  Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.  Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?  There's something I have to tell you.  I cheated in the contest.  The contest - I cheated.  Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.  Hey - What's going on?  We're straightening out!  I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private         jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.  First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,         tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the         good one - the Ted Danson plane.  Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.  He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.  Why would we want to help somebody?  That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.  All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and         get the hell out of here.  Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV         show.  Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I         realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.  Yeah, he's right.  It makes me look older.  Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?  Jerry, did you hear that?  I think that's a good sign.  He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.  Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us         killed!  The Bubble Boy!  Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?  Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.  Sorry, the card says Moops.  It's Moops.  Moops!  Help! Someone!  It was Moops.  Fire! Get out of the way!  Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.  Medium turkey chili.  I didn't get any bread.  Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.  Yes, please.  What?  You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.  Really?  Haven't we had this conversation before?  I think we have.  Excuse me, do you have a ticket?  Okay. Good.  Well, if it's as good as ``Ponce de Leon'', I'll be happy.  ``Ponce de Leon''? But that was great!  Lemme tell you sum'in. When Ponce looked in that mirror                and saw   You're not going to get back here in time!  I'm in line to buy.  No it's not, it's the ticket-<buyers> line.  Is this the ticket holders line, or the buyers?  But I asked you before if you had a ticket, and you said                no!  [furious] Good. It's good to be accurate like that.  It's the same movie! What's the difference?  Hey, you know what else is playing here? ``Rochelle Rochelle''.  I wouldn't mind seein' <that>.  So what's your point?  By the way, you owe me seven fifty.  No, I don't have any change.  Or, I could take the twenty, then I could pay *you* later.  Might be easier.  [trying to act as if he doesn't care one way or the other,                but we  So... Can I have it?  Whaddya mean, you'll ``get'' the popcorn and the soda?  I tell you what, you give me the twenty, and I will buy  You go in and save seats.  Well, why don't *you* go, and I could save the seats. You                said you  Why don't you give me the twenty, and I'll stop and get                change,  Psh. What's the point of even discussing it? [condescendingly                Um, excuse me, have you see a guy with like a horse face,  Yeah.  Uh, I just went out, I went to look for my friend?  [as if the word were totally foreign] My `stub'?  You don't remember me?  I went in with a pretty woman? You know, kinda short, big                wall o'   [whispering] Elaine?  [quite out loud, not even pretending to whisper] Elaine!  We've just been through this! You don't remember? We just                had   [realizing the only way out is to show the stub] I've got                the stub.  There you go, okay? That's my *other* friend's ticket.  Jerry?  Elaine?  [studying his jacket] Oh man! Look at this! I sat in gum.  I still paid for it!  You uh owe me for the ticket.  I read somewhere that this Brentano's is the place to meet                girls in New York.  I'm gonna hit the head.  (Acting innocent) I'm all set.  (Not sure what the answer should be) What do you want to                hear?  They made me buy it.. A hundred bucks this thing cost me.                (Gesturing to the book) How dare they?! I got news for you, if it                wasn't for the toilet, there  They're selling coffee, bran muffins.. you're surrounded                by reading material. It's entrapment!  I find the soothing pastorial images very conduc-  Well, I'm gonna go back there later and return it when                there's different people working.. You want to catch a movie?  (Praising Leo's stealing) Alright, Leo! Stickin' it to                the man!  You, uh, didn't dance again, did you?  You went home with him?  Hey, me too.  Well, unless you tell everybody you're dating.  Yes, I, uh, I need to return this book.  Why not?  (Confused) Flagged?  It says that on the computer?  (Outraged. Leaving) Well, you just lost a lot of business!                Because I love to read!  Well, I've to every Brentano's. This thing's flagged in                every database in town!  I don't understand what the big deal is. They let you try                on pants.  Nothing.  You know, I could let it go for.. say.. a hundred and twenty-five.  (Wanting Elaine to take it off his hands, he tries to silence                Jerry) Jerry, simmer down.  Simmer!  (The damage has been done. He is slightly angered at Jerry)                May I ask, what do you read in the bathroom?  Well, aren't you something?  Well, I assume there's some sort of write-off.  Uh, about two hundred dollars, Miss DeMooney.  Oh.  (Nervous) Wh-what are you talking about? That - that's                rediculous.  (Desperate to get rid of the book) Alright, I, I'll just                take fifty. Do - do we have a deal?  I could take it in merchandise..  I can't sell the book. It's been marked.  So, I'm gonna steal another one, and then return it. That                way, everything is even.  I'm goin' in!  No! Jerry!  This car out there is taking up, like, three parking spaces.  You have a car?  Me either.  Oh, hi.. (They shake hands)  Yeah. Why, what do you do?  Really?  (Laughs slightly) A physician married to a salesman. (Chuckles)                Well, I gotta tell you, Beth, you coulda done a lot better than                him.  Really? (Realizes) Well, you don't think it had anything                to do with what I said, do you?  You know, that, that thing about her being too good for                him. I mean, I was just bein' folksy. They could tell I was just                being folksy..?  Totally folksy.  Karin.  Great.  I think so.  I can't tell anymore.   Feel? What's that?  Yeah.  Cleaning  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tub is love?  Yep. There's one little problem.   Yeeeaaah. Well..... I've never really feld confident in..... one particular aspect.   Yeah.   I don't know. Last time I got the tap.   You know, you're going along, you think everything's all right and all of a sudden you get that tap. (George taps his own shoulder). You know it's like pfffff (whistling sound), all right that's enough, you're through.  It's like the manager coming out and asking you for the ball.  No, no, this wasn't moving on. I got the hook. I wish I could get a lesson in that.   You can go crazy trying to figure that place out.  Anyway, I think everything else is okay. Unless of course she's faking.   Nothing.  Nobody's faking.  She's not faking!  I know. I can tell. It's one of my powers. Why, did you ever fake?  You faked?  I think I'll have a piece of cake.  We got a chocolate malt in here!  I'm sure you are.  Maybe Karin is faking.  You seem like you really enjoyed your Risotto. You have a very contented air over there. You look very contented, very satisfied. Are you satisfied?  I'm sure if you weren't satisfied you would probably say something wouldn't you?  Hey listen... instead of the movie... maybe we'll go back and... you know...  So... you feel okay about that whole thing... what we do in there... generally okay with everything in there?  Do you feel the way you feel after the Risotto?  Yeah... full.  It's Jerry's fault.  Jerry and Elaine. They made me nuts.  So you feel okay?  It's all your fault! You and Elaine! All that orgasm talk. She did have an orgasm, she didn't have an orgasm. Orgasm this, orgasm that. I got so focused on it. I started to panic and boom, I lost it. I tried everything, I was talking to him: 'Please wake up, do something.'  I hate 'em!  It's like a magic trick. Sometimes I think it would be easier to bend a spoon mentally than to make that transformation.  Hey, was that a joke about Houdini?  Well if Houdini couldn't do it, what chance do I have?  All right, where do you want it?  All right I gotta get going.  I got a date with Karin. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Nothing happening down there.   I knew this was gonna happen some day. It was inevitable. I've known it ever since I was a little kid. I've been waiting for it.  That reminds me, I'm not getting you guys any more fruit. That guy was eyeballing me the whole time. He gave me the creeps. All right, you owe me twenty-eight sixty.   All right I knew it.  I don't want any mango.  Very good. Juicy. Ripe. This Joe's got some terrific fruit.   I feel like I got a B12 shot. This is like a taste explosion!  I think it moved. Oh my god, I think it moved. Yeah, give me the big piece. I'll see you later.  I'm back, baby, I'm back!  Please, it's not necessary.  The little extra moan you threw in there. Laying it on a bit thick, don't you think?  What am I talking about? Come on. You don't think I bought all that?  You're very good. Very good with the moanings and the gyrations. You really had me going there for a minute.  Come on: 'Oh George, oh Geeeooorge!' Come on! Not that I don't appreciate the effort that was put into it.  What?  But why?  I can't find my glasses.  I need to look for my glasses.  Where'd you meet her?  On an elevator? You met a woman on an elevator?  You got less than sixty seconds. That's like dismantling a time          bomb.   Wow. What'd you say?  Wow.  What did she say?  Not everybody knows what the crop circles are. (to the newsstand  What?  Oh, man, it's spinach! I've been walking around like this all  I had a job interview.  Take a guess.  Ok, thanks.  Yeah, right.  Oh, nothing.  You won't think I'm a bad person?  'Cause believe me, I would only say this to you and maybe a  I mean, big would even be ok, a little beyond big.  Now, I'm aware that my own physical dimensions are perhaps a          little  So who am I to be thinking about someone's nose? I mean, I should          be  I could never do that. You know the ironic thing is if she had          a  Why don't you just commit yourself already?  What, you didn't wash all day?  Thinking? Nothing. What could I possibly be thinking?  Oh, yeah, right. I wish I had something on my mind. (pregnant          pause)   They way he just says stuff.  Yeah. Yeah, he's quite a character.  About the pizza?  Oh, the nose job. I don't know, what did you think?  Yeah. (another pause) Not that I care, one way or the other,          but  Peter Jennings had one.  Probably. They all do. In my high school, half my graduating          class  It's really nothing, it's like going to the dentist.  It's a cleaning.  If it makes you happy, I don't focus on these things. I will          tell you  What the hell.  Me? I didn't say anything.  I didn't encourage. No encourage.  It's possible.  Me too, really. Unless you'd really like to get one.  I'm going straight to hell, no two ways about it.  It's exciting, isn't it? She's gonna have a whole new face.  Of course, not as exciting as miss crop circles, but...  You're not letting him win. He wins till you're forty.  He still wins but it's not a blowout.  Good for you.  It's like going to the bathroom in front of a lot of people and          not  Okay, look, Audrey, before you take the bandage off just remember          that  Yeah?  Very exciting, very exciting, it's like watching a birth.  Too much salt in my diet.  Nah, I'm good.  Mmm, no. Boy, it really didn't come out too well, did it?  It's like, all dented.  Well, I'm sure they'll be able to fix it. You can't stop modern  Shut up?  Interesting.  Yeah.  Oh, I got it.  Yeah, phew.  What?  We did?  Hawaii?  Oh yeah. My friend lived there.  You know, I have to tell you something. You couldn't get me on          a plane  So, Elaine, are you going to sleep with me or what?!  (Angered) Fine. I'll ask you again when you're rested.  Yeah, I hope so. For your sake!  You can stuff you sorries in a sack, mister!  I don't want to talk about it.  (While skimming a Monk's menu) You know, I didn't go to                the bathroom the entire time we were in India.  (While pointing at Jerry) Not me! Him! His fault! He betrayed                me!  You can stuff your sorries in a sack, Mister!  (To his girlfriend) Alright, Nina, you have to decide right                now. Jerry or me?  What?! Well, what are you doing here?  Five' eight! Five' seven!  (Whispering to Jerry) What time is our flight back? I got                to go to the bathroom.  (Struggling) No, no, no, no. I can walk it off. It's a                hundred and twenty degrees in here.. I'll sweat it out.  (Looking at her nose) Is your nose pierced?  Yeah. (Points to two open seats in front of Jerry's. To                Nina) Sit down there. (Sees Jerry in the crowd) Hello, Jerry. (Obviously                angered at Jerry) I  (Trying to keep his voice down) I think you've done a lot                more than talk! You betrayed me!  (Outraged) "That's all"?! That's everything!                I don't know what all the rest of it is for anyway!  You can stuff your sorries in a sack, mister!  It's an expression.  (Trying to whisper to Jerry) Look, we are gonna settle                this right now! I demand reparations! I should get to sleep with                Elaine. That's the only way to  (Losing it) Funny guy!  Elaine, you have to sleep with me.  Reparations!  (Loud, so everyone at the wedding can hear) You slept with                the groom?!  (Laughing nervously) No.. I'm gonna wear black shoes.  (Leading Nina out the airport) Oh, no. No. We're good.                Let's get goin'. Alright. (Almost bumps into Jerry) Watch it, funny                man. (Leaves)   Hello, friend. Enjoying the flight?  (Heavily sarcastic. He's angered at Jerry) Good one. Very                funny. You're very funny, Jerry. That's what I always tell people.                (Yelling out) Jerry Seinfeld's  Of course I'm all right. I'm here with my girl. Nina. And                what better way to pass the time than gabbing with my best friend..                with whom there are no  (Yelling out to the whole coach) Funny guy! (Points to                Jerry) Right here!  Ho, ho! Jerry Seinfeld's a funny guy!  So, Jerry and Nina, huh?  But you already told me everything.  Hey.  For how long?  Great. (Hugs Jerry) Jerry, I gotta tell you, I had the                best time with that Nina last night. I - I think I'm in love with                her already. You are a great friend. A  Great! Nina could go, huh? Jerry, this is great. You and                Elaine. Me and Nina..  (Asking Elaine) Jerry seem a little weird when I mentioned                Nina?  Why do you keep saying Nina?  Uhh.. I'll meet you down there. (Elaine leaves. George                instantly goes looking through Jerry's cabinet) Cereal, cereal..                (Picks up a bottle) Peach schnapps.  FDR?  (Guessing the look) Stink eye?  Oh, it's a bad day. Uh, you got everyone in your house,                you're thinkin', "These are my friends?!"  (Showing Elaine his boots) Timberlands.  Jerry, would you make the call already?  (To Elaine) Told me the same thing.  You-you sure you never slept with her? (Jerry shakes his                head 'no') Perfect.  (Rubbing his stomach) Ooh.. Something's not sitting right..  I'll have the clam casino.  (Showing Jerry the menu) "Chef recommends"  (Motioning tward waitress) I think she likes me.  So, how come nothing ever happened between you and Nina?                (Getting paranoid) Is there a problem with her? Is she a man?  Well, what's the reason?  How engrossing?  Wow! Heh. (Half kidding) You don't, huh, have a replacement                lined up for me, do ya?  I'm all for awkward pauses. Fix me up with her.. Wait a                minute, Nina just saw me in my Timberlands! Now I have to wwear                them every time I see her.  In any othe shoe, I lose two inches. I - I can't have a                drop down. We were eye to eye, I can't go eye to chin!  In every situation. No matter how silly I look. (Tastes                his meal) Hm.. tastes a little funky.  Ah, this is the kind of day that almost makes you feel                good to be alive.  Yeah, and a whole new me. I'm up two inches in these babies!  Five' eight. Five' seven.  Nice to meet you.  How as the date?  Whooo.. (To a waitress taking orders) Ooh.. French fries.  (Changing is order for Susan) Baked, uh, potato.  Sorry.  Hey!  Check that out (showing newspaper)  That's right.  What's that.  And the amazing thing is she eats like there's no tomorra'.                Wa?  Kramer, she's a model.  I have noticed she does tend to go to the bathroom right                after  Just enjoying watching you.  Yes, full. I love to be full ... love to sit back, loosen                the  Where you going?  You're fresh (grabs her arm) You're very fresh. You seem  Well, I heard a noise.  You know, .. blah ...  From the bathroom.  Every time we go out to eat the minute we we're done eating                Elaine, of course I'm concerned. I'm payin' for those meals.                Let me digest it. Let me get my money's worth. Y'know what                Hey, maybe I could bribe one of those women that hand out                the   Yeah  Wha?  You know a matron?  You  Kramer,   Well, what is it?  Wha?  Who?  Kramer, Kramer, I need to know if Nina is refunding.  Why not? Why not?  Come on, Kramer.  Cosmo?  Hey di ho  Hey oh.  It's all worked out. Nina and I will have dinner Thursday                at the restaurant  Oh, she's a Kramer. And uh, while I was there I uh happened                to pick up   I uh got the first name.  That's right. You ready?   Cosmo  Cosmo  Wow.  Oh yeah: HA-A-A, HA-A-A.  Hate the big coarse "ha." Hate those.  I see.  Well, if I hear you correctly--and I think that I do--my                advice to you  The Switch?  Can't be done.  Do you realize in the entire history of western civilization                no one has  Well, I'm sure at some point between the years 800 and  All right, dammit, I'm in.  All right. Let's get to work.  All right. That's enough for today. You're tired. Get some                sleep. I'll see  We'll come up with something.  All right. See you tomorrow. {George sighs, exits.}  I-I-I-I-I got it!!!!!  All right. Let's go over it again, one more time.  That's right.  Keep going.  Continue.  A few days go by and a call is placed at a time when Sandy                is known to  You disappoint me, my friend. Sandy wants nothing to do                with you. She  {George, finger in the peanut butter jar}: This is what                I do.  ... so glad.   And why shouldn't you? Be fresh Stay fresh  Uh, yeah. Do you know Babs?  Babs left?  I was just wondering what it was you wanted for dessert.  How 'ya feelin'?  What happened to Babs. She never showed up last night.                Hey, what happened with Sandy. I forgot all about it.   So what happened? She throw you out? Eh?  So what happened?  Into what?  That's unbelievable.   Do you ever just get down on your knees and thank god that  You're not goin to do it? What do you mean, You're not                goin  Are you crazy? This is like discovering Plutonium ... by                accident.  If only something like that could happen to me.  I know.  Hey, Cosmo what happened to your mother last night. She                hung me   It would have been nice if someone told me about it. I                just think you   Well where is she?  Ow! What are you doing under there? Hey, stop that! Don't eat          that! That's not food! <to Robin> He's suckin' down Equal packets!  25 kids for his birthday party? <to kid under table> Don't          put your tongue on the floor! He's putting his tongue on the floor! Here,          here, have some more sugar packets.  How about Bozo?  Who's Bozo? Bozo the Clown, that's who Bozo is. When I was a          kid, Bozo the Clown was   With the orange hair, and the big clown shirt with the ruffles...  And the TV show! He had cartoons!  You know, when I was a kid, we didn't have these elaborate birthday          parties with catered food and entertainment. I remember my 7th birthday          party...  Nah, I have asthma. <Robin's kid grabs George's leg from under          the table, and George struggles.>  Bozo?   B-O-Z-O?   You've never heard of Bozo the Clown?  How could you not know who Bozo the Clown is?  How can you call yourself a clown and not know who Bozo is?  Is he a clown? What, are you kidding me!?  Yes, he's a clown!  Alright, just forget it.  Alright, very good, very good...go fold your little balloon animals,          Eric. Eric! What kind of name is that for a clown, huh?  Well, I do what I can. <Robin comes over.>  Ah, great, great. <sniffs> What's that smell? Smoke? <walks          to the kitchen> Hey everybody, I think I smell some smoke back here...<smoke          boils into the doorway.> FIRE! FIRE! Get out of the way!  Because! Because, as the leader...if I die...then all hope is          lost! Who would lead? The clown? Instead of castigating me, you should          all be thanking me. What kind of a topsy-turvy world do we live in, where          heroes are cast as villains? Brave men as cowards?  Seemingly. Seemingly, to the untrained eye, I can fully understand          how you got that impression. What looked like pushing...what looked like          knocking down...was a safety precaution! In a fire, you stay close to          the ground, am I right? And when I ran out that door, I was not leaving          anyone behind! Oh, quite the contrary! I risked my life making sure that          exit was clear. Any other questions?  Its not easy.  So she doesn't want to see me anymore.  No, her too. And her mother.  Yeah. I may have stepped on her arm, too, I don't know.  Yeah. But it was somebody's arm.  To some degree.  In a manner of speaking.  Yeah. She should be commending me for treating everyone like          equals.  Perhaps.  Yeah. Eric the Clown put it out with his big shoe.  What's that?  Wow, he really does a number on you. <reads> "Seinfeld          froze like a deer in the headlights in the face of incessant heckling."  You know what you oughta do. You should go to her office and          heckle her.   You know, like all the comedians always say, 'How would you like          it if I came to where you work and heckled you?'  I'm not kidding, you should do it.  Well, go ahead! Do it!  No reason!  This is unprecedented!  What...are you using my babies now?  What accident?  That's unbelievable!  You ran?  Holy cow!  How could you do that?!  You're Batman.  Well, what about the toe? What happened to the toe?  You did all this...for a pinky toe?  Robin? Robin!  Robin, listen to me. The most amazing thing has happened. Kramer          has opened my eyes. I think I've changed.   O.k....<is about to explain. Cut to Jerry on-stage.>  ...you'll see, things will be different now - if you just give          me one more chance.   Alright, but I'm serious about this.  The prop comic? <Ronnie holds up his water gun and smiles.>          Oh, hi...I didn't recognize you, what...did you get a haircut?  Like you do.  What do you think? The brought it over in pieces and screwed                it together like a coffee table?  Why did France give that to us anyway?  So countries just exchange gifts like that?  There's Elaine.   Really? They work here in the office?  Who am I going to tell? My mother? Like I've got nothing                better to talk about.  Really?  "Off the wagon"?  I think it's "on the wagon".  Well today's your lucky day.  It will be my first one.  Huh?  How can you just get it?  Well, you know, book reports. That kind of stuff.  I like Mike Lubika.  He's a sports writer for the daily news. I find him very                insightful...  Lot of good ones. I don't even want to mention anyone because                I'm afraid I'm going to leave somebody out.   Who do I like? I, like, uh, Art, Vandelay.  He's an obscure writer. Betnik, on the village.   Venetian Blinds.  I think he was impressed.   Told you.  Do I really have to buy her something?  What is that? Is that cashmere?  Who doesn't like cashmere? Find me one person in the world                that doesn't like cashmere. It's too expensive.  Wow. Excuse me, Miss?  How come this sweater is only 85 dollars?  What? I don't see anything.  Oh yeah.  (grabbing the sweater back) Well it's not really damaged.                85 dollars huh?  You think she would care about the red dot?  I don't even think she'd notice it. Can you see it?  Yeah, but you know where it is.  Pretend you didn't know it was there. Can you see it?  Well just take an overview. Can't you just take an overview?                Please.  (over the speaker) It's George.  Hello everybody.  (uncomfortablly) Thank you.  It's an early Christmas present.  For you.  Of course it's cashmere.  Well who doesn't.  Ahh, money.  Well good, good. Take it off you're going to wear it out                already. It's for special occasions this thing.  Just take it off. I'm getting hot just looking at it.  What red dot? What are you talking about? Jerry come here                for a second. Do you see anything here?  I can't believe I get paid for this.  How you doing?  Hennigans. I was there sitting in the office and the cleaning                woman comes in. I've always been attracted to cleaning women. Cleaning                women, chambermaids.  Why is that?  So she starts vaccuming, back and forth, back and forth,                her hips swivelling, her breasts, uh... (trying to think of a word)  Convulsing?  Then I asked her if she wanted a drink.  I know but I couldn't think of anything else to say to                her.  So we started drinking, and I'll tell you I don't know                if it was the alcohol or the ammonia, but the next think I knew                she was mopping the floor with me.  Well the sex was okay, but I threw up from the Hennigans.  (over the speaker) It's George.  I have to talk to Elaine. This cleaing lady is turning                the screws on me. She's pushing for this whole relationship thing.                She keeps calling me, threatening to go to the boss with this thing,                I could lose my job, I gotta do something to keep her quiet.  Did you tell her anything?  Do you swear?  Oh you told her didn't you.  What? Did I what?  Elaine, I'm, I'm shocked. I'm shocked. Here I go out in                the spirit of the season (Elaine looking like she's not buying a                word of it) and spend all my savings to buy you the most beautiful                Christmas sweater I have ever seen to show my appreciation to you                at Christmas and this is the thanks that I get at Christmas.  You told her? How could you tell her? I told you not to                say anything.  Elaine you don't understand. I had 103 temperature when                I bought that sweater. I was so dizzy I was seeing red dots everywhere.                I thought everything in the store had a red dot on it. I couldn't                distinguish one red dot from another. I couldn't afford anything.                I have nothing. I haven't worked for a really long time. (Jerry                is standing right behind George. Jerry takes out a hankerchief and                starts fake-crying in it.) I mean look, I have no clothes, look                at what I'm wearing. It's just a little red dot.  This is for you.  As you care for me. Which is why it is very important that                you never breathe a word of this to anyone about the... you know.                What, with Clarence Thomas and everything.   Yes of course go ahead. My guess is you're going to like                this very much.  Of course it's cashemere.  Just a little something for Christmas.  I had a feeling you would like it. No, don't try it on                now, try it on later.  Take it off. You're going to ruin it.  Who said that?  Was that wrong? Should I have not done that? I tell you                I gotta plead ingnorance on this thing because if anyone had said                anything to me at all when I first started here that that sort of                thing was frouned upon, you know, cause I've worked in a lot of                offices and I tell you peope do that all the time.  Well you didn't have to say it like that.  What about the whole Christmas spirit thing? Any flexability                there?  You never had sex in the office before?  Alright so you made out with someone.  Kissing is sex.  Jerry.  No.  Over here.  Hide, hide under the desk.  Of course it's cashmere.  I can't eat this without catsup. Would it kill her to check up on us? Would         that be a terrible thing? "How's everything? Do you need anything? What can I do for         you?"  Do ya?  Same thing!  Excuse me. Are you using your catsup?  Nah - what for?  I've been to the movies.  They're all the same. You go, you sit, you eat popcorn, you watch. I'm sick of         it.  Yeah.  When is it going to be my turn, Jerry? When do I get my 15 minutes? I want my         15 minutes!  Ah! Health's not good enough. I want more than health. Health's not doing it         for me anymore. I'm sick  Oh, very gracious.  Yeah.  What are you crazy?  Big hefty stinking faux pas.  On-the-street cell-phone call is the lowest phone call you can make.  It's dismissive.  Why don't you think before you do something?  Too much?  Boy - I'm really surprised at Elaine - that whole phone business - she should         know better than that.  What?  You're so uptight.  Who's he?  Our show, "Jerry"?  "Jerry", oh my God. He wants to talk about "Jerry"?  When?   Right now? "Jerry"?  He wants to talk about "Jerry"?  "Jerry"!  Can I go like this?  No sports jacket? I don't need a sports jacket? Writers wear sports jackets.  I won't feel like a writer.  Right!  Water. Need some water! Water here!  Don't worry, don't worry, no scenes.  I will not blow this.  It's fine, it doesn't have to be about nothing.  Something, nothing, I could care less.  Anything, everything, something, nothing - Who the hell cares? Put me down. I'm         down!  Magic time.  Hey, hey, hey!  Hello Stu.  Jay Crespi, how am I gonna forget Jay Crespi?  Kimbrough.  K-I-M-B-R-O-U-G-H  It's a talent I have.  Woo! Some day out there - You ever see weather like that? Woo! It's crisp -         it's crispy crisp.  What do we have in the fruit department?  Oh, that's a dangerous fruit. It's like a weapon that thing, got spikes on the         end. You can get killed from   Been there, done that.  Water coolers?  See, I think people would talk about it at the coffee machines.  It's really not accurate. Nobody drinks from a water cooler any more - they use         bottles.  I tell you, I really don't think so-called relationship humor is what this show         is all about.  Or we could get them together. Woo!  Yeah!  I'm moving to California.  Of course he liked it.  He wouldn't put it on if he didn't like it.  I'm writing.  Ma?!  I don't need any ideas. It's a show about nothing.  So? Where are we going?  If you're bleak, you're bleak.  It's a bit hilly - no?  What if I want to walk around a little?  What if I'm at the bottom?  Me too.  This is it?  I'm sorry - I have to say, I'm a little disappointed, I thought it would be a         lot nicer.  You think this is the plane that Ted Danson gets?  Still, I bet when they gave him a plane, it was a lot nicer than this one.  This is a real piece of junk. I don't even feel safe on this thing. I have a         good mind to write a letter toMr. Kimbrough.  Why?  It's effeminate to sit like this?   How is this effeminate?  Kramer, what are you doing?  Would you stop that? It's not safe to be jumping up and down on a plane.  Kramer, don't be fooling around up here.  Kramer!  Oh my God!  I told you to stop with the hopping.  Just when I was doing great. I told you God wouldn't let me be successful.  Jerry? Jerry can you hear me?  There's something I have to tell you.  I cheated in the contest.  The contest - I cheated.  Because I'm a cheater! I had to tell you.  Hey - What's going on?  We're straightening out!  I'm not getting on a regular plane now - I'm all psyched up to go on a private         jet. No way I'm getting on a regular plane.  First class doesn't make it anymore. Now you get on the phone with Kimbrough,         tell him what happened and tell him to get another plane down here, but this time, the         good one - the Ted Danson plane.  Yeah, just tell him to hurry it up.  He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.  Why would we want to help somebody?  That's what nuns and Red Cross workers are for.  All right, so what's the penalty here? Let's just pay the fine or something and         get the hell out of here.  Oh no no no no - we have to be in California next week. We're starting a TV         show.  Would it kill him to check up on us? No - drops off the meals and that's it. I         realize we're prisoners, but we're still entitled to catsup.  Yeah, he's right.  It makes me look older.  Vandelay? The judge's name is Vandelay?  Jerry, did you hear that?  I think that's a good sign.  He's actually doing him a favor. It's less money for him to buy food.  Hey! Great plane! Thanks a lot. Piece of junk. You know you almost got us         killed!  The Bubble Boy!  Who invaded Spain in the Eighth Century?  Oh no - I'm so sorry, it's the Moops. The correct answer is the Moops.  Sorry, the card says Moops.  It's Moops.  Moops!  Help! Someone!  It was Moops.  Fire! Get out of the way!  Yes, sir, that was a good sandwich, sir.  Medium turkey chili.  I didn't get any bread.  Um, excuse me, I think you forgot my bread.  Yes, please.  What?  You had to hop! You had to hop on the plane.  Really?  Haven't we had this conversation before?  I think we have.  It's all departures. I see nothing but departures. (to the woman  Excuse me, sir, do you have the time?  Where?  But you have a watch on.  Why don't you just look at your watch?  Let me see the watch.  You know we're living in a society!  Jerry. Jerry.  I just got here. My car broke down on the Belt Parkway.  One mile from the exit it starts shaking, really violently shaking,  No.  How do you know?  We should take his limo.  Wait a second. Think about it. He's not showing up. Wait till          you  What are you doing?   Oh yes, by no means, the mood. Let me know if there's anything          I can do to lend support to the mood.   Um, cream soda?   I was, I had to leave. She lit some vanilla incenses. The smell          drove me nuts, all I could think about was food, I had to get out of there.          We need some pudding here! Pudding!   I told I had a bus transfer that was only good just for another          hour.   I don't know, I was starving Jerry!   Oh, pudding! You want some?   What are you kidding? We look great! You know what this pudding          needs? The skin on the top, you know like your mother used to make it          on the stove.   So eh, what do you say?   Ok, we got your...got your strawberries, your chocolate sauce,          your pastrami on rye with mustard, your honey...   Oh yeah yeah, don't you know they used pastrami in that movie          9 weeks? Remember the pastrami scene?   Well, maybe it was Ghostbusters? Where ever it was, it worked!          No.   She tolerated the strawberries and the chocolate sauce, but eh,          it's not a meal, you know? Food and sex, those are my two passions. It's          only natural to combine them.   Jerry, I'm not suggesting getting rid of the girl. She's integral.          Hey, speaking of which, I found a great way to separate the skin          from the top of the pudding without leaving any around the edges; Exacto          knife.   Well, I guess these would be out of the question. [pulls out          two pudding skins in plastic bags.]   Pudding skin singles.   Oh, Tara!   Three pints of Kramer's blood?   Well, so much for purification week.   Doing quite well, thank you. Yesterday I had a soft boiled egg          and a quickie. You know what? If I could add TV to the equation, that          would really be the ultimate.   She's right, I heard Kramer got mugged out on the suburbs on          a baby-sitting gig.   Oohoho...spicy mustard...woohoho, you're hot tonight!   And now for the trifecta. [Picks up a hand held TV and gets back          under the covers.]   Pleasuring you?   I got greedy. Flew too close to the sun on wings of pastrami.          I don't know. This sandwich is making me flush.   I think you're right. You gonna eat that?   These fries are really really good...   Uuh, sleepy.   Yes she is. It's a pity we won't be seeing much more of her.          Oh, you haven't heard, she's going to live with her grandparents          in Redding Pennsylvania.   Yes they did. I was covering. Elaine has been deported back to          Scotland.   All right, no more lies. Elaine is been chosen to represent the          Upper West Side in the next Biosphere project.   That's because it's underwater.   Is it?   Well, it's all for charity, so what's the difference.   Well, I'm also an architect. Is that pastrami?   Very.   Vivian!!   Yeah, Jimmy why don't you wait outside, you know, play with something.          Ouch!   I'm baby-sitting! Vivian asked me to raise him if she doesn't          make it.   9:45  Why not?  What, you are comparing me to Biff Loman, very encouraging.                The  Lesbian wedding. How do they work bride and groom out,                what do they  What, was that not politically correct? It's a legitimate                question.  I get the feeling when lesbians are looking at me, they're  Yeah.  How many tickets are you paying today?  No doors?  I can't carry any changes in these pants, it falls out.  That guy is not blind.  I can't believe they actually found your stolen car.  That's amazing.  What are you? Satan? I'm close to a job here. It's my second  Me, why?  Oh, no no no. I was just looking for stock-pages.

What's the difference you just read it and mail it right                back. These we'll do.  So we pick up some Elmers  Hey! Kramer.  It's Susan  It's coming Jerry, it's coming.  The Day..  We ordered the wedding invitations today,, Nothing can                stop it now. Nothing. It's here! It's   I can't  What about a letter?  I...I...write a letter and then I..I go to China.

I don't think you're anything.  Those are Susan's friends.  Well...I'll ask Susan about it later.  ( to Jerry) What about the letter, should I think about                the letter?  Smoking.  Yes, she hates cigarettes.  Nooooooo......  Listen I was talking to Elaine today and she said she'd                would really like to be an usher at the  That was an honest mistake.  Yeah! You're right.. You're probably right.  (shrugs and lights it up)  (coughs) I've always smoked.  Oh yeeah.. well , Big smoker... I (coughs some more) gave                it up for a while but it was too tough.  Well(coughs) I can't stop now...(coughs) I'm addicted...(words                missing)  Oh my god....  No..  Well Kramer's not an usher anymore.  You've been demoted.  Because you called her by the wrong name.  Who!!?  Do you see what this is turning in to? Do I need this.                I have to get out of this thing.  Yeah.. They made me sick.  Yeah...  What does that mean?  What does that do?  They are?... Elaine?  Pre-nup of course ..Kramer....  Hi.  Yeah. Got to invite The Drake. Listen hem...there's something                that's been on my mind and  Well I I ..put a lot of thought into this and I think I                would like you to sign a prenuptual agreement.  Yeah.  What's so funny?  See ya later.  Married , What!(astounded)  Good for you (sympathetic)  Hehehe. .(feebly)  Tsss...Yeah..  I don't know....hmmm ha! here's the doctor.  Well , not yet.. Fianc.  .........What's that?...  ...Are you sure?  So.....She's dead?  ...Huh!  ...Why?  Well she was sending out our wedding invitations.   We were expecting about two hundred people...Well...Thank                you , thank you.  She's ahem....gone  Apparently the glue in the wedding invitations was a....toxic.  (embarrassed with a touch of unrestrained jubilation) Yes.  Yeah?  Yeah?...  Hey!.. What can I tell ya.  well humm.. lets get some coffee.  Yes I'd like to speak to Marisa Tomei, please?  Can I come upstairs, please? <Elaine pushes the button and          lets George in.>  Nothing, I... said it was a little problem.  Anyway, I think the guy in the shower opposite saw me. He gave          me a dirty look.  Yeah, so what? I'm not the only one! <Kramer enters with his          quilt.>  Well, what was I supposed to do? Get out of the shower, put on          my bathrobe? Go all the way down to the other end? Come all the way back?  Oh, no...no, that's very bad for the kidneys.  Medical journals!  They could kick me out of the health club if he tells them!  Talk to him!  You said the guy gave you an open-lipped kiss!  Well, that doesn't mean anything!  Well, what about the open-lipped kiss?  Yeah, you're right, you're right. <To Elaine> Alright,          maybe he's not interested, but you still know him - can't you just ask          him?  Why?  Aha. Aha. Could it be because you don't want him to know that          you have a friend who pees in the shower, is that it?!  Oh, I think it is! I think that's exactly what it is!  I was there! I saw a drain!  It's all pipes! What's the difference?!  I'll call a plumber right now! <Goes for the phone.>  What happened? Did he bring it up?  Signal? What signal?  I'll tell you what that is - that's a violation of club rules.          Now I got him! And you're my witness!  A guy leaves a puddle of sweat, that's a signal?  What if he left you a used Kleenex, what's that, a valentine?          Now you go up to him and you tell him that if he's thinking of turning          me in, that I got the goods on him!  So you're gonna let me get suspended for shower urination?  Because of me? You must be joking! Who wouldn't want to                live because  You can do better than me. You could throw a dart out the                window and   I'm bad. I'm *bad*!  So what could I do? I couldn't go through with it. She                threatened  Yes. Why, is that so inconceivable?  I got two tickets to see "Guys And Dolls".  What paper does she write for?  Lyndon Johnson was uglier than Degaulle.  So, whaddya say? You know you'll always be the only man                I'll ever love.  [quietly] C'mon, go along...  I guess that leaves me in the clear...  I just thought of a great name for myself, if I ever become                a porno   Yeah, how did you know that?  Allison bought it for me.  I dunno. I guess I have to wait for her to die.  Jerry did you wash this pear?  It looks like it hasn't been washed.  You hear the way he talks to me?  Jerry said he didn't like it.  No, you said you didn't like it...  Yeah. Actually it was in gym class. I was trying to climb                the ropes  No, I got my own place.  My parents? They don't know *what's* goin' on...  No, of course not...  Absolutely...  My *father* is gay...  Look, you wanna have sex right now? Do want to have sex                with me right   No!  Hey.  So, what did she say?  Y'know... I could hear you on the other line...  I heard what you said: "Sharon, are you there?".  Yes, I heard you!  Maybe she wasn't! Maybe she heard the whole conversation!  "There may be a problem with the phone, hold on"!  "The phone's a piece of junk, goodbye"!  Now she thinks we're gay, not that there's anything wrong                with it...  Y'know there are tribes in Indonesia where if you keep                your coat on  Not at all.  Two tickets to "Guys And Dolls"! I'm gonna go                with you!  It's "Guys And *Dolls*", not "Guys And *Guys*".  Now everyone's going to think we're gay!  No, not at all...  Hello?  Mrs. Seinfeld?!?  Oh, my God! My *MOTHER*!!!  Yeah. I'm Buck Naked.  Of course not...  Alright, now the play is tomorrow night. So do you want                to have dinner  No. Just imagine her reaction.  Oh, my God...  She hasn't seen the article! When she sees it, she's gonna                think--  Yeah so??  Don't you see what it says here? Don't you understand what                that's  I'm gay! I'm a gay man! I'm very, very gay.  Extraordinarily gay. Steeped in gayness.  You don't believe me? Ask Jerry.  What do you mean you will? That's a bad idea. Jerry is                a very   Jerry! Oh, my God! What are you doing!?!  You're with a *woman*!  I leave you alone for two seconds, and this is what you                do! I   Alright, tell her. Go ahead.  Y'know. About *us*.  Alright, I'll tell you the truth. I'm not gay. My name's                Buck Naked,  Is there ever a good time to have your parents stay with you?  When are they leaving for Paris?  What about her place?  Really? (Jerry shakes his head) Maybe this will become like a          cool thing, living with your parents.  Hey believe me, baldness will catch on. When the aliens come,          who do you think they're gonna relate to? Who do you think is going to          be the first ones getting a tour of the ship?  Hey by the way my parents really want to have your parents over          dinner before they leave town.  Hey Alec  Hey Joey, how you doin'?  Well uh....  Well, sure Joey, sure, I would be thrilled.  What could I do? Did you see the mug on that kid?  Ya it used to be right in the middle of single Jeopardy and now          they do it right after single Jeopardy.  Oh, n-no comparison.  (stops Jerry realizing something) Hey hey hey hey hey hey.  Your parents are going to Paris right?  So I tell Alec that I have to goto Paris for an undetermined          amount of time. Then all I have to do is buy some post cards and have          your parents mail them from Paris.  Who?  I'm trying to get out of this Big Brother program. So when you          get to Paris (handing Morty the postcards) all you have to do is drop          'em in any mailbox.   Well no not yet, you gotta buy french stamps (pauses) I-I'll          reimburse you of course.   Really? My father has a ton of old clothes just sitting up in          the attic, y-you think they're worth something?  What happens if the husband dies after the wife, who brings in          the clothing in then?  (pondering) Yes I suppose they do.  (grabbing his jacket) Hey oo, I just remembered uh my parents          really wanna have you guys over for dinner before you leave town. What          about tonight?   Yea they're making Payaya.  Well um, what about tomorrow night?  Ok uh, I guess I'll tell them that.  (quietly) Ya.  Ya.  No, they had plans.  That's what I wanna know.  They said tomorrow, maybe.  I don't know what the reason could be.  Anyway it's kind of a fluke thing but uh I'll be leaving for          Paris in two days. I will send you a postcard when I get there.  Yea, ya..ya know I feel terrible about Joey but it's jus..it's          a great business opportunity. I-I don't even know how long I'm gonna be          away for.  An apartment complex, the uh the Eiffel Towers. uumm Like I said          uh you'll be getting a postcard uh in a few days and again I'm sorry.  Fantastic?  How gee what a coincidence.  I dunno they said maybe.  Yes a cruise, a long cruise, just the two of you.   I-I wasn't in the attic.  Maybe it was a mouse.  What?  You haven't even seen one.  "Master of the house.. doling out the charm, ready                with a handshake and an open palm. Tells a saucy talke, loves to                make a stir everyone appreciates a.."  Oh, it's from Les Miserables. I went to see it last wee.                I can't get it out of my head. I just keep singing it over and over.                It just comes out. I have no  Artie Schumann? From Camp Hatchapee?  What are you, Bud Abbott? What, are you calling my an idiot?  Oh, Schumann. Of course.  Really? ..Well, what if it doesn't stop? (Jerry gestures                "That's the breaks." George gasps) Oh, that I really needed                to hear. That helps a lot! Alright, just  Yeah, he'll be looking at us like he's backstage at a puppet                show.  "Master of the house, keeper of the inn.." (Jerry                proudly models his new jacket infront of George. George looks in                admiration at the jacket) This is huge!  (Nods) Can I say one thing to you? And I say this wiht                an unblemished record of staunch heterosexuality.  ..It's fabulous.  And I'll tell you something else, I'm not even going to                ask you. I want to know. But I'm not going to ask. You'll tell me                when you feel comfortable.. So  Well, I'm going with him. I'd like to, I've never done                a solid before.  "Master of the House. Quick to catch your eye, never                wants a passerby to pass him by."  Maybe he didn't show up.  I don't think there's ever been an appointment in my life                where I wanted the other guy to show up.  (Sees an elderly man sitting on a leather chair) Wait a                second, is that him?  I'm nervous.  (Holds out his hand for a handshake) It's a great thrill                to meet you, Sir.  And, I'll have a club soda with no ice.  You like ice?  I said, do you like ice?  Don't you think you get more without it?  Yeah, yeah. She's punctual.. and she's been late sometimes.  I guess today she's late.  Yep.  (Perks up) I know, I know, that's what they said.  The weather guy, Dr. Waldo.  No, of course not. I didn't..  (Pointing at Jerry) Oh, he's the comedian.  No, no. He's just being modest.  I just wanted to tell you that I really enjoyed Fair Game.                I thought it was just brilliant.  Maybe some parts.  The drivel parts.. Oh my gosh, I just realized - I have                to make a phone call. I can believe.. would you.. (Gets up, and                leaves)  Thank you for leaving me alone with him!  Well, let's just leave.  Where is she?  How could she leave us alone with this lunatic? Ten more                minutes, and that's it! I'm leaving. I have to tell you, this guy                scares me.  If she doesn't show up, we can't possibly have dinner with                him alone.  We'll say we're frightened and we have to go home.  I don't know. Just start scratching. Tell him you have                the crabs. He was in the military. He'll understand that.  (Caught off guard) My uncle is having an operation. I just                wanted to see how he was.  Bone marrow.  Sure, Guatamala.  Come on, let's go!  To hell with Elaine!  We're dying here!  (Mocking Alton's voice) He's in the bathroom.  Couldn't be better.  Get outta here..  Where do you come up with this stuff?  "Master of the house, doling out the charm. Ready                with a handshake and an open.."  I wouldn't think so.  (To Jerry) Why don't you just turn it inside out?  It's only a few blocks.  (through mouthful of food) So, Carrie, you and Susan are   (jokingly) Well, so, legally, I could marry your daughter.  (negative) Hu-ho, boy.  Ech. What else you got?  Aw c'mon, I'm eating here.  Pamela?! Awright, I tell you what. You look like nice people,          Soda. S-O-D-A. Soda.

Ah, alright. Believe me, that kid's gonna be called Soda.  Oh, no no no. Course not. I got a great name for our kids. A          No, Seven.  Yeah.

Hey, hey hey. Don't worry about me. I'm not a waffler. I don't          (shouting) What happened to Soda?! I thought we all agreed on          You don't care for Soda?!
