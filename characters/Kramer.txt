Alright, you can have it. Okay, I'm gonna take the suit, and          the shoes, and the hat.  Hey, I'll look like Joe Friday in Dragnet. (Hums out the theme          song)  Oh, uh, well - okay. (Balls up the clothes he just got, and throws          them into his apartment, and leaves)  Let's go get him.  You wanta go get him?  I say we get him.  I'm not happy about this.  I'm not happy about this.  Police! Open up!  Freeze, mother!  Shut up. Spread 'em. I said spread 'em! (Looks around) You're          in big trouble son. Burglary, grand larceny, possession of stolen goods..          and uh, uh.. murder.  Shut up! Keep 'em spread! Just make love to that wall, pervert!  (Afraid he's got the wrong guy) Is your name Ray?  (Assured) Yeah, you're the punk I'm looking for. (Grabs the statue          from the mantle, and puts it in his bag)  Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a good cop. I'm a damn good cop! Today's          your lucky day, junior, 'cause I'm gonna let you off with a warning. Any          more of this criminal activity, and you'll be sorry. You got me?  Good. Good. Let's keep it that way. (Exits)  Yeah.  Well, let's put it this way: I didn't take him to People's Court.  Well, I'll think of something.. (Slaps George on the back - sending          the statue crashing to the ground)  Well, it's coughing, Jerry. It expells the                diseased germs out of the body, into the air. (Makes a guesture                of germs being in the air)  Yeah, well, uh, Newman. He's - he's got it.  Yeah, and I rented out half that space to                Newman. (Starts coughing again)  (Looks at the bags on the floor) Evidently.  (Coughs) Hey. How's everybody? (Moves to the                kitchen)  Ehh.. (Picks up a carton of food) No expiration                date on this.. (Opens it, then starts coughing directly onto the                food)  (Shrugging it off) Nah, no, no, no. No doctors                for me. A bunch of lackeys and yes-men all towing the company line..                (Looks at Jerry, then leans in so  (Complaining) I'm even more potent now!  (Like a teacher) The Andrea Doria collided                with the Stockholm in dense fog 21 miles off the coast of Nantucket.                (Makes a clicking sound with his  it's in my book - "Astonishing Tales                of the Sea" 51 people died.  That's it?! I thought it was, like, a thousand!  There were 1,650 survivors.  Oh yeah. I also got "Astounding Bear                Attacks"  Yeah, oh, yeah. Yeah, he's not gonna do it.                (Leaves)  Ok, hold on there.. That's a nasty cough you                got there, huh?  (Between coughs) Hey.  (Petting Smuckers) Yeah, this is Smuckers.                I borrowed him. (Starts coughing)  (Pointing at the dog) Yeah, we share the same                affliction, so I'm gonna have a vet check us out.  Oh, I'll take a vet over an M.D. any day.                They gotta be able to cure a (Snaps his fingers in rhythm with his                words) lizard, a chicken, a pig, a frog (Stops  (Smiling) You bet we are! Huh, Smuckers? (Smuckers                coughs. They turn to leave) I'll see ya.  Well, uh.. it hurts when he swallows. Expecially                when he drinks orange juice. (Vet gives him a look) I mean, uh..                dog food.. juice. (Adding) What's  (Offended) What? No. That's disgusting..  Yeah, yeah. (Pulls a bottle out of his pocket)                I got some pilss. They taste terrible.  (Gestures to his throat) No, my throat's too                tender.  I don't want to!  (Squirming) Jerry! What?!  (Struggling) Hey!  Whe have the same symptoms.  No, no. No doctors.  Where are you going?  I don't know..  I don't see any tissues back her.. (Looks                out the windows) Wait a minute!.. (Jerry looks like he's trying                to keep something from Kramer) This isn't the  No, Jerry!  No! Don't!  Hey.  I'm watching The Bold and the Beautiful.  What?  Five minutes. What?  Because I've been watching too much. It was an addiction.                I couldn't stop. It was, it was destroying my brain cells.  Well, wow.  Hey.  Oh, no. There's nothing out there for me.  Weather? I don't need weather. Weather doesn't do it for                me.  No, no, I don't want it back. (Pause) Are you gonna watch                the Knick game tonight?  Will you tape it?  Yeah. (He exits)  I'm in. Let's go for it.  I don't care, whatever.  Okay. What are you getting?  What's a Chow Fung?  What do you mean, a broad noodle?  Well I don't want a big flat noodle.  Who says I want a noodle?  All right. I'll get pea pods and you can't have any of                my pea pods.  Get extra MSG.  Hey, you got the food?  What took you so long? Hey, Ping!  Yeah. Where's yours?  Oh, that's too bad.  (To Jerry) Hey, you watchin' Oprah?  (To Jerry) No, I don't want it back.  (To himself) Hey, look. An hour with Patrick Swayze.  You, you guys wanna hold it down? I'm watchin' Jeopardy.  Oh, by the way, George. Susan called for you a minute ago.  (To the TV) Who is Joseph Cotton? Giddee up!  (To the TV) What is pi? Ooh! Giddee up again.  (To the TV once again) What is the cha-cha? Ooh, yes indeed.  What is here comes the judge, here comes the judge!  Hey, buddy. How was career day?  They're trying to screw with your head.  Why does Radio Shack ask for your phone number                when you buy batteries? I don't know.  No, come on. (Larry the cook comes over)  Come on, Larry. You know me.  What, did they kick you out too?  Hey, you got any matches?  Thanks. (Kramer leaves, phone rings)  Ashtrays?  Ooh, cereal bowls.  All right, thanks. (Kramer leaves)  Need some more matches.  I met some people smoking on the street, so                I invited them up to my apartment to smoke.  Well somebody had to. You know, just because a person's a smoker, that doesn't mean he's not a human being.  Jerry, these people aren't just going to let themselves be flicked into the ashbin of society.  Well you can confine them, you can punish them, you can cram them into the corner, but they're not going away, Jerry.  Yeah.  All right, I'll see ya Bill. All right, I                got room for two, but the only thing I have is in the non-filter                section. (Jerry enters) Hey.  Oh yeah, people really seem to be enjoying                themselves. You know, they come in once, it's like they're addicted.                (Katie enters)  Hey buddy.  Hey, you should come over. Tonight's pipe                night.  What?  My face is all craggly, it's crinkly.  Emphysema, birth defects, cancer. But not                this. Jerry, my face is my livelihood, my allure... my twinkle!   Everything I have I owe to                this face.  Look away, I'm hideous.  Jackie we gotta talk.  But Jackie--  Jackie, I think I gotta case against the tobacco                companies.  The tobacco companies.  No, it didn't say anything.  So Jackie, do you think we gotta case?  Who could love me?  Bye-bye. Jackie, you did it. We're rich.  It was a great lunch, Jackie. Thanks.  Mrs. Wilkie, from the tobacco company called                me. We had a little pow-wow.  She made an offer. I took it.  No, no, no. There was no money.  Check it out. (They see a Marlboro man billboard                with Kramer on it)  (Imitating a Turkish terrorist) You! Take off your socks,                your pants, your underwear. We're doing the wash. C'mon! Take it                off, take it off!  Hey, Georgie.  (Laughing) She caught you?  Oh, like you're gonna stop?  (Butting in) Wait a second, wait a second. Count me in                on this. (Clicks his tongue)  Yeah.  (Making a point) Not everyday.  No, a thousand!  Alright. (Holds out his pinkie at the center of the table)  Hey, look at this, c'mere. There's a naked woman across                the street.  Second floor from the top. (Pointing) See the window on                the left?  ..Yeah.. (Pause) yeah.. (Slowly stands up, and walks out                Jerry's apartment - leaving Jerry and George with the view, he shuts                the door behind him)  (Declaring) I'm out!  Yeah, I'm out - I'm out of the contest.  Yeah, yeah.. (Notes their reactions) what?  (Singing) Goood Moorrrnninng!  Ha, ha! Nothing like some good solid sack time. (Turns                toward Jerry's window)  (Turning back to Jerry) Oh. So, did you make it through                the night?  So, you're still master of your domain.  Woah, woah, woah. What-what did you just say?  Do you hear what you're saying?! Can you hear it?! (Jerry                puts on his coat) This is a beautiful woman walking around naked,                and you want to tell her to  (Stopping him) No, no, no, no. You can't! You can't! This                is something that comes about once in a lifetime! When we were boys,                looking through our  No, I'm not gonna let you do it, Jerry.  (Frantic) No, no, no. Don't do it. Don't do it! For my                sake! God knows I don't ask you for much! (Pleading) Now, come on.                Please, Jerry. Please! I'm  Yes!  (Moving to the window) Thank you, thank you, thank you.                (Sits in Jerry's chair, looking out the window)  Oh, I can wait..  (Obviously watching the nudist across the street) Oh, that's                good. That's good. That's very, very good. Oh, it's hot in there..                (Jerry looks back at  The woman across the street has nothing on, nothing on,                nothing on..  Well ... I like the sound it makes when you walk on it.              No, no, no, no. These brown things. The chairs. Jerry,                this is the set from the old Merv Griffin   Look at this. Boy, one minute Elliot Gold is sitting on                you and the next thing -   No, no, no. You go on ahead. I'm not finished taking this                in.  Hey, Jerry! Come in here a sec! Hey!  It's the Merv Griffin set  Oh, you just bring it in sideways and hook it.  Yeah ... backstage.   Oh, well a lot of the stars from the 70's - they were not                as hygienic as they appeared on TV  All right. Well, Jerry, we'd love to have you back anytime<                Jerry exits> Well, Elaine Benes!   That's interesting. You know someone mentioned to me you                were not very happy with your toys growing up.  Oh, that's right, right, right. And uh you mentioned that                uh, you didn't get a G.I.

Now, uh you and Jerry                dated for a while. Tell us ... what   <laughs too loudly> All right, let's take a short                break. .... Okay! We're back!  El Paso? I spent a month there one night.  To take some of the pressure off of me. So, Jerry, what's                going on with you? I understand   Well. It sounds like things are progressing. Do I hear                wedding bells?  What do you mean "wrong kind of medicine"?  Wait a minute, wait a minute! You mean to say that you                drugged a woman so you could take   Smile, everyone! We're back!   Well, we've officially bottomed out. Who's our next guest?  We need a new foreman.

Edgy, youthful, plus ...                we got Jim Fowler!  Well, I practically raised his kids.  What? Two animal acts on the same show? What is this, amateur                hour? Look, George, I'm   Okay. a little later, we're gonna be talking with animal                expert Jim Fowler.  But first, we're talking with Jerry. Okay, Jerry, uh, you                drugged a woman in order to play with   And she doesn't know anything about this?  Well, Jerry, we have a little surprise for you! Come on                out, Celia!  It's the new format. Scandals and Animals. Go with it.  George I told you we're booked!  Ohhh. another interesting confrontation. This could be                spicy. Yeah, George bring him over.  Are we getting this?  Well, the squirrel kept scurrying and the hawk kept clawing.  I tell y'a it was a grind trying to fill 10 hours a week.                I'm not sure I was ready to have my own   Michael Richards  Well I just got it. Spector gave it to me , he's giving                everything away...becoming a minimalist.  ( to George) You , you know what you should've done is                watching that report on CNN last night.  You can't call China now its like, what, three 'O clock                in the morning there  Give me it..( tries to pull them off George's head)  All right Come on....again attempts to pull headphones                off)  C'mon it's my turn.  Where's the volume..(finds it) A, YAI..YA...YA..YA!!!!                Just be yourselves.

My mother told me that he got arrested for mail fraud  He's in jail.  That's what I intend to find out. (George comes out of                the bathroom and he's got white cream on his head)  It stinks. Can you smell that?....You stink.  How often do you cut your toe nails?

[takes some meat from the                refrigerator and closes it] Ya know, I almost wound up going to                that game.  Yeah. [Jerry sits down on the couch. Kramer sits down next                to him and starts turning over the pages of a magazine. Suddenly                he spots an article he likes and tears it out. Jerry looks at him                with a "what-the-h...-are-you-doing-look" and Kramer asks:]                Are you done with this?  [glues the article back with his own saliva and puts the                magazine back on the table] When you're done, let me know.  I thought I wasn't allowed to be in here this weekend.  You want me to talk to her?  Oh, I can be very persuasive. Do you know that I was almost...                a lawyer. [shows with his fingers how close it was]  You better believe it. [The phone rings. Jerry picks it                up]  Give me it...let me talk to her [continues this way].  A SLIDE!...Wow!  [walks in behind the dog and closes the door] He really                likes you, George.  [the dog runs to the bathroom and apparently starts drinking                from the toilet] Oh, he's getting' a drink of water. [sees the mattress                on the floor] Is this for that girl?  Why even give her an option?  [stands up from the couch and yells.] WHY EVEN GIVE HER                AN OPTION FOR? [Jerry walks to the bathroom and closes the door;                to George, while pointing to the mattress] It's unbelievable.  ...How's the real estate-business?  Do you handle any of that commercial...real estate?  [slaps George on the arm] You keep me posted!  Hey, you got any Double Crunch?  Now what does the little man inside you say? See you gotta              listen to the little man.  The little man knows all.   You want a picture like that on a Christmas card? I can              do that for you. ...  No, no, I'll take your picture. I'll take care of everything.  All right, ... now, you come on over. I'll have my cereal              and I'll take your picture.  I don't know about that outfit though.   Well, we'll have to improvise.  Hey  Hey, how ya' doing? [Trying to enter]  I just wanted to borrow your Dust Buster.  Hello.  How tall are you?  Come on lets see - Back to Back.  What's the matter with you? I just wanted to see how tall              she was.  What's that?   That smell. What's that smell?  It's very familiar. I can't put my finger on it. It's very              familiar.  Yeah, okay, So I'll see you tomorrow uh?  Yeah. Nice meeting you.  [OC] THE BEACH!!!  You smell like the beach. What's the name of that perfume?              you're wearing.  CALVIN KLEIN? No, no. That's my idea. They, they stole                my idea. Y' see I had the idea of a cologne that makes you smell              like you just came from the beach.  Whooo, ... That's you! What is going on here? The gyp(?)                he laughs at me then he steals my idea. I could have been a millionaire.                I could have been a fragrance millionaire, Jerry. ... They're not              going to get away with this.  Hey!  What card?  Yeah, yeah. Of course. I took it.  No.  Yeah, so?  That's a nipple.  Ooo!  Aw, no, no I didn't notice it. no, uh,   I got them too.   Got any Double Crunch?  What's that perfume?  That's mine. That's my smell. Jerry you've got to get that              model to get me an appointment with CALVIN KLEIN.  I thought you said it was a scratch.   Let's go.   I want to talk to Calvin.  Let me talk to Calvin.  Yeah, uh.  I'm here to talk about the ocean.   Now I don't want any trouble Calvin.   All right, now here's the scoop, Jockey. I, uh, I came              in here last January to talk to one of your ffflunkies..  Yeah.. And, um, when I told him my idea about the beach              cologne, you know, he - he laughed at me.  Well, yeah.  You know, I try to take care of myself. I - I watch what              I eat. Ah, just recently I cut out fructose.  (Flattered) Oh?  I've got the magazine. The underwear ad came out.  What?   Hey. All right. Hi. Check it out, official police caution                tape. Look at that.   Uh-uh-uh. Step back, son, there's nothing to see here.  Well, I got it from my cop buddy Doug.  They want to know why they never see you.  I'm gonna eat that later.  Oh no, no,. no. I had to fish around in the evidence room                for it. You know, they're all preoccupied, trying to hunt down this                new psycho-serial killer, the Lopper. All right, I'll see ya.  Oh, it's no big deal. It's just some guy who's been running                around Riverside park-pffff. You know, cutting people's heads off.  Well, you know, the police, they've been having some internal                dissension about the name.  Uh, Headso...uh...The Denogginizer...Son of dad.  Yeah. That was my suggestion. It's sort of a catchall.  Well, more bad news Jerry.  You know the police, they found another victim of the Lopper                in Riverside Park. I saw the photo, and it looked a lot like you.  Not as many as there used to be.  You know, George, you're not gonna find an electrician                like that in the yellow pages. Now, I know just the guy who can                do this.  Oh, no, no, no. This guy is no friend. In fact, we don't                even get along.  Oh, he's the best...and the worst.  Believe me George, you can count on Slippery Pete.  Yeah, I don't care for the name, either. In fact, that's                one of the things that we argue about.  Dng-ga-gng-ga-wt.  Yeah. I dropped an egg. Be careful.  Lock and load.  All right, all right, come on, now.  Hey, you weren't home, so I signed for her.  You weren't even married yet.  Yeah. It feels like we're stealing it.  George, I thought that was the door.  Oh, hey, Elaine. What, you got the munchies?  Oh, yeah--Sotheby's. Yeah. They make good cake.  No, but I know I've seen cake just like that. Oh--Entenmann's.                Yeah.  Well, no. They're not really in the supermarket. Yeah,                they got their own case at the end of the aisle.  George, they closed up.  The pharmacy's still open.  Ahh! I'm out! No tape left!  Hey, Morty.  Hey, Mrs. Seinfeld.  Crazy Joe Devola.   Well, I was having this party and I didn't invite him and Jerry          tipped him off.   Oh, yeah, yeah. I was a little off last week - but the doctor          says it was just a slight concussion   Oh, yeah. He's after Jerry now.   Yeah, I like him. Hey Jerry, what time you got?  When you getting it back?  Next week? How come it's taking so long?   I said how come it's taking so long?   wait a minute, wait a minute, where did you take it?   Yeah.   Jimmy Sherman's?  Yeah, I know the guy. I take my stuff in there all the time.          Yeah, I bet I can get your watch back by tomorrow morning.  I'd be happy to.  Hey, I'm going to get that watch back for you by tomorrow, buddy.  I'll get that too. (exits)  All right.  Wait, wait , . . .   Oh, oh, uh, he's got my Calamine lotion and uh, I told him not          to return it. If he needs it he should keep it. He's got uh, he's got          a thing on his ankle.  I'll take it. No, I'll take it. What is it?  A box of cigars?  Oh, yeah?  Castro eh? Pasto costillo homiga (nonsense Spanish)   Wooo, you know what you just did? You let a burglar into the          building.   Federal Express? Of course. It's the oldest trick in the book.          You know it might not be a burglar it might be a murderer.  Yes. It's dangerous.   Okay, . . .   I came back for you.  I'm going to be right back. I'm going to get a match.  You know I can't find a match anywhere.  This is a good cigar (hair is on fire) . . . WOOOOOOOOOOW . .          . (runs to bathroom)  Why be uncomfortable if you don't have to? It's organic.  It's purple 23. Remember that.   Hi, little buddy.  Hey, listen, I gotta go somewhere.  All right, I'm sitting down. How are you? [Kisses Estelle                on the  Oh, yeah, good for you. Hey, you have to look your best.                You're  So, who is your doctor?  [whistles]. He's good. He's *very* good.

My name is Kramer.                Cosmo  All righty...  [signs it] Okay. [The clerk hands him a manila envelope].                Thanks.  Cosmo Kramer.  No! I'm not the Assman.  Here you go, buddy.

You know, I'm working                on one  Because *you're* silly. Get it? [hands the Fusilli to Jerry]  Oh...yeah. I got my new plates. But they mixed them up.                Somebody  Assman.  Yeah. Assman, Jerry. I'm Cosmo Kramer, the Assman!  Yeah, or it could be a proctologist.  Have you ever *met* a proctologist? Well, they usually                have a very  Oh! There's my phone. [He leaves]  "Call me. Thirty-six, twenty-four, forty-six. I think                I have what  Ah, yeah. Doctor Cosmo Kramer. [points to plate] Proctology.  Thanks. Have a good day.  I just can't get over how fantastic you look.  Oh, yeah. This takes twenty years off.  Oh, yeah.  You got that straight!  Hey, well, this is Sally.  Shall we go?  Hey.  Hey, Frank.  C'mon, Frank, relax. I don't even know what you're talking                about.   Bro.  Bro!  Jerry. Jerry, come here. Take a look at this.  The name on the boat. Look at it.  Yeah [points towards the doctor's office], he's the Assman!                Jerry,  Yeah, excuse me, uh... You didn't by any chance recently                get the  So...you're the Assman.  Oh, hey!  Hey, hey.  Definitely.  No, no, I would turn you in.  Phwap, I wouldn't even think about it.  What kind of person are you going around killing people?  Well,, if you'll kill this person, who's to say I wouldn't be          next?  I thought I DID!  Hey, don't do the crime if you can't do the time.  You better believe it.  Since when are you so trendy?  I've been drinking Caf Latte since the fifth grade and I haven't          looked back.   I've always wanted to see this.  Well, yeah, lets do it uh?  Maybe I will.   Why not?  Well that's stupid   Well, we'll just see if we can't get around that.   Oh, yow, oow Ah!   Nothing Nothing.   I don't have anything. Ask him.  What?!   Ow  Hey buddy.  (tossing car keys to Jerry) Yeah.  You shoulda come, Jerry.  Price club.  Ah, the steering wheel fell off. I don't know where it is.  What're you doing. (fetching the bottle from the trash) Don't          You don't pay five cents, you get five cents back. Here, read          Yes.  That's Michigan. In Michigan you get ten cents.  Yeah.  No, it doesn't work.  Yeah, you overload your inventory and you blow your margins on          No, no, I'm off that.  Oh yeah. Every which way. Couldn't crunch the numbers. It drove          No, an eighteen-wheeler's no good. Too much overhead. You got          Newman, it's a dead-end, c'mon. (Jerry enters) Hey, there he          (to Newman) Aw, that's right, we forgot about those.  We ran outta space.  Ah, Tony, he's good.  (offering the artichoke can) 'Choke?'   Wha...?  Look, Newman, I told you to let this thing go.  (interested) Uh-huh.  (realisation) Mother's Day.  A free truck? Oh boy, that completely changes our cost   Newman, you magnificent bastard, you did it!  I'm sorry. I thought it was a legitimate charity. I didn't                know you'd get audited   No, blame me.  Don't blame me.  It was supposed to erupt.  You know what my feelings are about this. I don't even                pay taxes.  When do you pit the sauce on?  I like to strain the sauce.  Yeah, Tina likes the couch.  <chuckles>  Yeah, it's a windshield.   I found it on the road.  Can you believe somebody threw this out? You know I'm going                to make a  wow  hell-oo  I, I saw her naked.   Well, you know, ... it was an accident.   I thought it was a closet.   Completely naked.   All right. I'll tell you what. If it's going to make you                feel any better you can see me naked.   No, I want you to see me naked.   No, I want to show you.  Well, it's a windshield. It's going to be your new coffee                table.   You know what they do in there? Did you see CooCoo's Nest?                They put those electrodes in   My friend Bob Sacamano had shock treatments. But his synapses                were so large, it had no effect.   Hey.  Uh, you want some leftovers? I made some African food.                There's, yambalas and uh, sambusa.  Yeah, yeah, I'll be right there baby.  So, is everything cool? or what?  Oh,  No, lets go to the couch...  Hey, Are you going to the hospital now?  All right, great, great uh, we'll share a cab.  I wouldn't walk over there.  It's the most dangerous part of the sidewalk. Cab hops                a curb, wap! You've  I'd much rather get hit by an 80 pound air conditioner                than a two ton cab.  Much rather take it to the head, Like I did in '79.  Don't really remember.  You get the tickets?  Death Blow: When someone tries to blow you up, not because                of who you are,  Yeah, I know, but he's a big fan of the genre. You know                I'd consider it a  Uh, listen, do you want me to stay here until George gets                up?  There's no problem, really.  Brody's in.  Well, you better get on the horn.  There's Brody. Brody! Over here.  Brody, c'mon. He's just kidding. He's a joke maker. Tell                him, Jerry.  All right, here we go, Death Blow. (Brody takes out video                camera)  Relax, he does that all the time.  He's making a copy of the movie for sale on the street,                huh?  But I want to--  Well, it's a perfectly legitimate business.  It's a business.  He's a friend of a friend. You know Corky Ramarez up on                94th Street? One day he and I are playing Pinochle--  Man, we're missin' the Death Blow!  Go get 'em, Death Blow! (To Brody) You okay?  Well, it's no wonder. You ate that entire bag of candy.  Jerry, if the man is in pain...  Okay. Let's everybody just relax. Jerry, take the camera.  (To Brody) C'mon, let's go.  Hey man, so how was the rest of Death Blow?  Yeah, who got the final Death Blow, 'cause I thought that                Hawaiian guy had it comin' to him!  He's quite a character, isn't he?  I got it. Yep.  Come on up. It's Brody.  Jerry, you did him a favor. He probably wants to come up                and thank you.  It's your first time. He'll understand.  Hey, Brody!  Uh yeah. It's under the couch.  Look at you! You've got another gig!  But you have a gift. Jerry, this is not your little comedy                act. We're  Sure, do you need a glove?  (laughing) The French guy fell off the bike. Oh man, that's                precious. (eats popcorn)  That's fine.  It's about a guy buying a loaf of bread.  Wha? Where?  Nah, he's not going to know the difference.  So you'll do the movie? (Jerry watches the movie Kramer                shot)  Right here. (Elaine enters)  (He shows her) This umpf thing.  No, no. That ain't dancing, Sally.  You stink. (He exits)  I know, Jerry. It's okay. (Jerry steps aside) Yeah, look,                Brody. Uh,  Jerry...  Jerry!  Yeah.  Listen, man. You gotta shoot this movie for me. Brody,                he's a reasonable man, but he's insane!  Jerry, George got arrested.  Yeah. He went at the   Beekman, he tried to land, but they                cheesed him.  Well, I gotta give him something. Come on, where's that                tape I shot?  Jerry, she taped over the whole ending! (Brody enters)  Uh, yeah, yeah. Here it is, Brody. One copy of Cry Cry                Again.  Although the whole story kinda comes apart at the end there.  Yeah, it's a disturbing image.  Hey.  Where you going?   Really? What is Bette Midler playing? Is she going to be there?          Bette Midler is going to be in the park today? Yeeee. Jerry,          don't tease me.   So maybe I'll go down there and watch, uh? She'll be there, ,maybe.  Who's Gennice?  Oh, uh, is this uh, Bette Midler's understudy?  Oh, understudies are a very shifty bunch. The substitute teachers          of the theater world.  You know, maybe in Korean "dog" isn't an insult. Could          be like the word "fox" to us. Oh, she's a DOG!   So she's coming?  Look it's Bette It's Bette! Ah, Ah, AH, . . . Bette, psst, hi.  Uh, I just want to say I think you're wonderful.  Yeah, I've seen you in everything you've done.  Anything I can get you? Water? They got ice over here.  Chocolate, Lemon, and uh, Cherry.  Pineapple, sure, alright, I'll be right back.  Oh, uh, uh. [Leaves]  I GOT THE PINEAPPLE. : I GOT THE PINEAPPLE.  (holding bette) Don't worry Kramer is going to take care of everything.          See,, I got you Pineapple. I saw Beaches last night for the fourth time          (sings) "You are the wind"  Come on Jerry, open up. I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE!   SO...you're all in here together. How convenient. I hope you're          all proud of yourselves.  So my dear you think you can get to Broadway. Well, let me tell          you something. Broadway has no room for people like you. Not the Broadway          I know. My Broadway takes people like you and eats them up and spits them          out. My Broadway is the Broadway of Merman, and Martin, and Fontaine,          and if you think you can build yourself up by knocking other people down...          ...GOOD LUCK... (exits)  [on phone] A turkey sandwich. A side of slaw,  you want          whit e meat or dark?   Yeah, white meat. And if I see one piece of dark meat on there.          It's your ass buster.  yeah, all right, yeah. [hangs up] They don't have any.          But don't worry I'm going to get you one somewhere.  Now that's impossible.  Hi, here. I made this for your. [gives her a pasta statue]  It's macaroni Midler.   Yeah, see how you're singing?  oh, what's that from?  Oh You are so freaking talented.  Oh, so look who's here. What do you want.  No, no. I'm sorry it's out of the question.  I'm calling the shots around here so there won't be anymore ACCIDENTS!          AH! I don't want her disturbed.   Nothin.'  What state?  They're never in contention.  Because I've seen every Miss America pageant since I was six.          Giddy-up!  No way!  Look, if you think I'm just going to step aside and do nothing          while you defile this woman, you're crazy.  That's right, because I'm going to see it doesn't happen. Look,          Jerry, these girls are Miss America contestants. It's every little girl's          dream. And I'm not going to let you trample that dream and make a mockery          of everything the pageant stands for.   Now, if you want to go out and have some good, wholesome fun          with a nice girl, I'd be glad to help you out...if you're looking for          something more than that, you've got the wrong guy, buddy! <Jerry tries          to get a word in during this entire speech, but Kramer won't budge an          inch.>  If you were Miss America, what would you do to make the world          a better place?  This is important stuff! She's got to be able to answer these          questions. She's not going to have time to think, out there, with millions          of people watching her. Any hesitation could cost her the crown. You know,          poise counts.  Oh yeah, like last year? Miss Texas? Now, she should have won          easily, but she lost points in the swimsuit competition.  Tape her breasts together. <Jerry is shocked.>  Well, take you for example. Now, you're very attractive, but          you got a big waist.  Well, I'd recommend a waist cincher.   Oh, yeah. Just -   So, what's your talent?  Mmm. I'm thinking of a number from one to ten.  No, five. But you were close.   How's your evening?  Stop right there.  Disaster.   Well, you got brown eyes. You want to wear a green dress.  Okay. But if I'm going to do this, we play by my rules or we          don't play at all.  Hey.  Oh, come on.  Oh, you're poo-pooing!  Well, let me tell you something. I'm taking this kid to the top.          To the top, Jerry! We're going for the crown, and you can't stop her!  You   No. Alright, watch me now. <Karen sits on the bed. Kramer          walks across the room like a Miss America contestant with a big smile          on his face.> Turn, back, head up, shoulders back...posture. You see?          Posture.  Let's try a few more questions, alright? <Karen stands up.>          If you were Miss America, and the U.S. was on the brink of a nuclear war,          and the only way the conflict could be averted was if you agreed to sleep          with the enemy's leader, what would you do?  Yes, they're important! If you stumble, if you hesitate, you          can kiss the crown goodbye. Now if I've told you once, I've told you a          thousand times - poise counts! It's just as important as the others. Swimsuit!    What is it?  How did this happen?  Accident? This was no accident. These doves were murdered.  Well, that's it! She's out of the pageant!  Her birds are dead.  Yeah, birds. She's got these trained doves, she does this magic          act, that was her talent for the pageant. You know what I think, Jerry?          I think somebody murdered those doves. Somebody wanted her out of that          contest bad. Somebody who was just eaten up with jealousy. Somebody who          just couldn't stand to have the spotlight taken off of them! <Kramer          turns around and notices the empty icebucket on the edge of Jerry's balcony.>  Well, don't think you've won, because you haven't! This kid is          a fighter! And if you think I'm gonna let a couple of dead birds get in          our way, you're crazy!  How ya feelin'?  There's nothing to be nervous about.  Poise. Poise!  What are you looking for?  No, no, no.  You're in a weird mood.  Fix what?  what is this? What have I got one pant leg on for?  No, t's a joke.. a joke... a joke... you think this is funny?  Wha-huh-wha-huh...  I don't believe this.  No, I swear.  Me?  What's this?  A dry-cleaning bill for what?  Oh, come on George! I didn't do that on purpose!  Well, neither should I! Jerry's the one who left the milk in          the refrigerator.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Yo-yo Ma!  What about him?  Jeez!  For what?  what about?  I can't, I'm going to the doctor's later.  Well, I can't!  Shut up! I'll get my coat!  No.  Uhm...  I never had an air conditioner.  Why? It gets hot at night, you can't sleep. You ever tried to          sleep in a really hot room?  Well, I slept in really hot rooms and I wanted to kill myself.  I was never able to become a banker.  Yeah, yeah. If I can't be banker, I don't wanna live.  MUST be banker.  What do you mean 'my own words'? Whose words are they gonna be?  All right.  What was the question?  Uh, well, my father when I was a kid, he took me to the bank          and he lifted me up and he pointed to the teller and he said: 'Sonny boy,          take a good look at him, that's gonna be you some day.'  I don't know.  From who?  From you?  You called me?  what?  What banking?  I'm distraught!?! Wooh-wooh-hoo!  Never said anything about the banking.  Hey!  What are YOU doing here?  Davola?  No, I didn't see him.  You're gonna do the circus freak show, uh?  Run, run! Go, go, go!  I saw the whole thing!  You know, my friend Bob Saccamano made a fortune off of                those. See he came up with the idea for the rubber band. Before                that, people would just hit the ball, and it would fly away.   Come on, Jerry, you're going to miss the exit.  Oh, boy.  I'll tell you when you can go. Wait, wait, wait, Wait--                now, now, now. No, no, no. Go, go! No, no. Wait-- now, now! Now!                Jerry! Go--ahh...  You want me to moon him? Ooh, let's moon him. Roll up your                window. Let's do a pressed ham under glass.  Look at this, look at this. He's giving us the finger.  Yeah.  Why are we slowing down?  All right. I'm gonna check it out. Aiee. mucho trafico.  Yeah...uhh...well, the streets are all blocked. I think                every Puerto Rican in the world is out here.  Whoo. Wrong car. Sorry.  All right, gentlemen, I scouted it out. I think we can                get out over there.  You know, you should make yourself throw up.  You know you're going to.  Hey, Jerry. You know who the grand marshal is of this thing?                None other than Miss Chita Rivera.  No, no, no. It was Mara Conchita Alonso.  Oh! I know who it is. Stacy Keach.  Con dios? Well, that's rude.  You know, actually, Jerry, you haven't worked a room that                big in a while.  You want to get outta here? Here's what we do. We leave                the car here, we take the plates off, we scratch the serial number                off the engine block, and we walk away.  You've got insurance. You tell them that the car was stolen,                and then you get another one free.  All right, what is your deductible?  Yes, because they've already deducted it.  The car, which we're leaving. So the net is zero. See you                pocket the money, if there is any, and you get a new car.  All right. If you refuse to grow up and scam your insurance                company, you'll have to work this out with maroon Golf.  Ok, here's the deal. He wants you to acknowledge that you                cut him off with an "I am sorry" wave.  You raise the hand, lower the head-- "I'm sorry, I'm                sorry. The buttons are really big on the car. I don't understand                it. I haven't read the manual. Ooh!" You get my drift.  Yes! All right, Lamar, back it up a little bit so we can                get out now.  Hey, Jerry, crank up the Floyd. It's a George laserium!  Wow. He's givin' you a mustache. Where is this guy?  You'll be fine as long as it doesn't hit you right in the                pupil, 'Cause then the whole ball will go up like the Death Star.                Tchoo! I gotta go find a bathroom.  Yes, uh, I'm interested in the apartment.  Ok.  Oh. Delicious to meet you.  Uh, yes, most likely, yes. I'm, uh, H.E. Pennypacker. I'm                a wealthy industrialist and philanthropist and, uh, a bicyclist.                And, um, yes, I'm looking for a place where I can settle down with                my, uh, peculiar habits, and, uh, the women that I frequent with.                (sniffing wall) Mmm. Mombassa, hmm?  Oh, I spend that much on after shave. Yes, I buy and sell                men like myself every day. Now, I assume that there's a waterfall                grotto?  How about a bathroom?  Yes, and where would the absolute nearest one be?  Oh, thank you.  Hola, Jerry! I'm into this Puerto Rican day! The sights!                The sounds! The hot, spicy flavor of it all! It's caliente, Jerry!  Yeah, I know! I was watchin' the game.  Come on, man. You need to lighten up. You know, a feeling                like this only happens once a year.   Yeah, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.  See, now you're getting the spirit of it, huh?  Ooh! !Dios mio!  Oh, no.  It was an accident.  Now look, I just have one thing to say to you boys. Mama!  Uh, yes, uh, I--I wanted to, uh, stop by and make sure                that my shark tank fits-- uh, hello.  Uh, Varnsen.  Vandelay.  The factory?  Jerry, that's in Sweden.  Well, you know, it's like this every day in Puerto Rico.  Well...there's no logical explanation. All right. Well,                shall we go home?  Well, Jerry, you can't deduct it now.  This was a fun day. It's nice to get out.  Leapin'                Larry! Yeah, that's where I bought this.

Oh, so                he took you back.  Well,                you know the important thing is that you learned something.  Yeah,                and this is just the Upper West Side. Wait until I get to the  Leapin'                Larry's? Hey, that's uptown. You gotta take Amsterdam.  Are you                ok, cowboy? Where do you need to go?  Well,                you'd better take it easy.  It's Kramer!  DeSoto's                down, but Cosmo's got the caboose.  Don't                worry, Cap, I can handle it!  Hey.  [taking Jerry's couch cushion] Yeah.  Yeah. Elaine, she has to leave her armoire on the street                all  Yeah, but this is so nice and thick. Ahoy there!  Yeah. Well, you ask for it, you got it.  Well, a bowl of muligatawny would hit the spot.  Yeah. It's an Indian soup. It's simmered to perfection                by one of  He's not a Nazi.

This belongs to a friend of mine.  Huh?  What is this, huh?  Well, b -- it was stolen.  These street toughs, they robbed me.  Yeah. It was very frightening. My life was in danger. You                should've  Well, where's the soup?  Oh...yeah!  Yeah.   Yeah.  Elaine, I'm really sorry about the armoire.  No.  Yeah. They were..quite taken with it.  Hey.  All right, [claps hands] I'm gonna go get some soup.  And then they just ran off with the armoire, just like                that.  Well, my friend is awful disappointed is all. You know,                she's very  How can I possibly thank you?  You suffer for your soup.  You demand perfection from yourself, from your soup.  Git.  And..voila!  Yeah.  Yeah. Did the K Man do it or did the K Man do it?   Yeah!  How 'bout zero?  Yeah.   I'll tell ya where I got it. I got it from the guy you                so callously  Yeah.  Well, I told him the whole story and he just let me have                it. Wha --  Yeah. Well, a little bit misunderstood but, uh....  Yeah. Well, he's a dear.  Oh. Jerry, those are the guys that mugged me for the armoire.  Yeah.   Yeah. That's them.  No. No. No. No. Let's get a cop.   No!  Excuse me.   Uh, well, uh, we --  Well, wha -- I, uh -- uh, we were kind of, uh, talking                to each  "Well Bob Sacamano he stayed with me once for a year                and a half."  "About some tickets George , you know I'd kill for                a peek.."  "Euh what...What lot is that?"  "Seventy -five bucks a month!"  " Oh I'm down."  (frantically pulling at his doorknob) "Thank god you're                home. I'm wiped out.  "y'did.........phfwelll. Look.. hum..... Can you take                me over there?"  "Oh Come on Jerry, It's all the way over to twelfth                avenue.."  "I'm not going to take the bus that's why I got a                car!"  "Awright I'm gonna get George to pick me up."  "Listen, Can you take me over to the Jiffy Park?"  "I like 'em all"(still fiddles with the radio)  (seems to pickup something on the floor) "....'s'this?"  "Gawd!!!"  "That's a....ca.....ca..........Condom!!"  "Wait a minute I need those keys. I wont be able to                get into my apartment.  "...Yeah I like Cadillacs (cautiously) Why ? What                you got on your mind?"  "Mary Kay uh?"  (to George)" Well listen See you later ..thanks for                driving me by..  "Oh yeah!!  "Heeeeeummmrph.... I'm gonna turn in"  "Yeah,I had a tough day"  "Well ..I don't argue with the body Jerry. It's an                argument you can't win."  "Well you can go to your room and read."  "But I'm tired.."  "Aah! He's got a girl up there. This quilt is too                thin...I know I'm gonna get cold.  "Can I sleep with you?"  "Well you got that big comfortable bed and that nice                warm quilt."  "Why?"  "Yeah!"  "Well I......( Elaine pops in at that moment)  "Hi...........What's that?"  "Wow."  "Yeaaahmm...."  "Ooh Mama...( walks away)  "How do you know he's not wondering the same thing                about you?"  "What do I mean?.. Well perhaps he thinks that you're                working him for the  "Now see the two of you need to work on trust... and                then and only then will there be a free  (softly)"hmmm....patio furniture's on sale."  "It's Halloween (not sure)  "Hey! Elaine.."  "These are my friends Jerry and Elaine."  "Yes, she's the costume designer and he's the wig                master for the show."  "Well what are we ...dog meat."  "Yeah. See ou later.."  "Hey! Who do you think you're talking to."  "Bye!!"  (looks inside the car and gasps) Ohhh Sweet Maria. Hey!                lets go.  "Hey What are you doing in my car? Hey!Hey!Hey! Where                you going."  "Cool it lady ( they struggle and we here a siren)  (cries) I'M NOT A PIMP.!!!.  You'll get used to it. It's like a grubby scrub.   And to the bathroom.   Kruger? That's not Kruger Industrial Smoothing, is it?   Grinders, sanders, wet stones. They are the ones who botched          the Statue of Liberty job.   You now what you do? You sneak that photo out of there for couple          of days and get it air brushed.   You remember that photo of me and Gerald Ford and I took it in.          Got that Ford right out of there.   Look at this. This sandwich is terrible. Everywhere you go, they          give you this misshaped shardy meat. Look at this...   I haven't had a decent sandwich in 13 years.   Hey, our meat problems are solved.   I traded it to my sausage press. Look how thin that is, see that's          all surface area. The taste has nowhere to hide.   Hey, spice. [gives Elaine a piece of meat.] Welcome to flavor          country.   You know, that happened to Lomez, so he blew his neighbor's circuit.          Yeah well, that's easy. Just let me finish this mile high and          I'll be right with you. Oh, and Jerry, we are gonna need a case of Kaiser          rolls.   This hallway smells like potatoes.   Ok, oh, you see this socket it's probably connected to her apartment.          So what we'll do, we'll take this paper clip and bend it so it'll short          out the entire circuit. Here you go...   No no no. It's easy, you just...do it quickly.   Well, I don't want to either.   It's just...it's no picnic.   Alright, fine fine, I'll do it.   Oh mama.   I will lose that nail.   This slicer is indomitable.   You buy enough meat, they'll give you anything.   See, that's the same thing that happened to Lomez.   Well, he moved to a hotel and the cat eventually died.   Oh, that's a prickly one.   The slicer! Elaine, let's go.   The cat. Just grab that meat and let's ride.   I think we are looking half a millimeter.   Oh, I've cut slices so thin, I couldn't even see them.   Well, I guess I just assumed.   Yeah, that's a hall of famer.   Alright, here we go. Yeah, watch that baby slide...[Puts a slice          of meat under the door.]   Oh no, I don't think so.   Well, you're not checked at on it.   Well, where the meat goes?   Where do you turn it on?   But where does the meat go?   Elaine, alright where's the SP2000? Cause I gotta slice.   Ok, I'll go with you.   Oh, well you have fun...[Elaine leaves] oh no clowns...hate clowns...the          clowns.   Elaine?   Yeah listen, I need my slicer back.   Hey, what's going on?   My blade is all dinged up. Oh, come on! Elaine!   Come on, this is important! [Shakes the door handle and it comes          loose. Kramer falls backwards to the next door.]   Wow, that's a lot of potatoes.   So, George took my slicer down to Kruger and they're smoothing          it out for me.   Boy, that looks like an allergic reaction. Have you been wearing          a fake beard?   Well, what have you been doing?   Whoa whoa, backup, Dr. Sitarides, what happened there?   There, there's your hives.   Jerry, as the Bible says; Thou who cureth, can maketh ill.   Now you listen to me, you've got to find this woman and tell          her that you're not a test tube pin cushion.   Alright, great, because I got to get down there and pick up my          blade. Hey, and I couldn't find that stock room.   He is just setting the record straight.   Doc, huh?   Moles, yes. Freckle's ugly cousin.   You really are cooking up a little scheme here, aren't you?   Male mammal. Approximately 30 to 60 years of age. Weight...uh          indeterminate. Ok, Mr. Kruger, we are gonna take a photo now for the records.          So if you'll stand up please and give me a big smile, oh no no no, not          that big. Yeah, that's nice, yes okay. Yes, let's have a looksee...ok,          so eh, fiber from shirt on the left shoulder. I'm gonna have to keep my          on that.   Uuh, long long time. Yes, I've seen moles so big they have their          own moles. Freckles that cover two men.   Oh, so far, so good...[looks at Mr. Kruger's shoulder] yeuye...          George, we got a problem.   Well, he's got a mole on his shoulder. Very suspicious.   George, why would I, a Juilliard trained dermatologist, send          him to another doctor?   He thinks I am. I'm not gonna betray that trust. Here's what          I wanna do; I think I can get a section...   Yeah, if I could crab my slicer and he'd hold still...   It'll be operative thing, he would barely feel it.   Well, it's my medical opinion, that you're making a big mistake.          And it's going in my chart.   [Points to a page on the book] Squamous cell carcinoma.   George, that's what he has and I have to give him a call. Now          we gotta came clean.   I don't want this on my conscience.   Yeah, alright...   They've got everything there, Jerry. I underlined the best parts.          Well, that's weird.   Well, I'm cleaning my slicer.   So, somehow the Bronzo (?) is reacting to the poison she's giving          you.   Ohh, that's toxic. [Jerry throws the towel over Kramer's head.]          Ououou....   Do you want more pastrami?   Yeah, it was olive loaf. You want that?   Oh yeah, coming up...   Hello boys, top of the morning to ya. What do you say?                What do ya be?  So, what are you guys doin this weekend?  Because I'm going to e playing golf at the Westchester                country club. Hum.  Oh, that's right buddy. It's private. It's very private.                But I met the pro at the golf shop up on 49th St.   Man, I'm going to be hitting the links all weekend. foooo  Why? What wa?   Well,   Well, I'm off to the links.   Listen, I want to thank you for the invite up state. I'm                sorry I can't make it.   Wait, wai, ... ... Yeah. Hello!, Hi, Aw, this is Kramer.                Yeah, I'm the next door neighbour. Aw, well you know,   So then I drive all the way up to the country club and                then I find out they got a tournament goin' on. Do you mind  These are Cubans. <IN FAKE SPANISH> Maria, poquendo                los scientos de estes con gleam.  Hey, anybody home?  Huh, hold these <boxes of> pies.   Naomi, come on let's get goin'.   Nah, it's good for ya'. Retards the aging process.   Let's go. OK,   <singing> ... wild funky mountain man ...  <runs to burning cabin> My Cubans!  Hey.  Did you hear about Martin?  I cant believe hes in a coma.  Hes got my vacuum cleaner. You know I loaned it to him.          He never returned it. The carpets are filthy. What am I going to do?   Newman! Hes good friends with him.   Hes got all of my attachments, you know.   What, Gina? Why wait? Why not just call Doctor Kavorkian?   So whats going on between you and Gina?  Uh, uh.  Uh, uh, you see thats the great thing about Mediterranean          women. All right, so what did you do?  Ah, what kind of a man are you? The guy is unconscious in a coma          and you dont have the guts to kiss his girlfriend?   There is no coma etiquette. You see thats the beauty of          the coma, man. It doesnt matter what you do around it.   Id give him 24 hours to get out of it. They cant          get out of it in 24 hours, its a land rush.  NOTHING LEFT! Thats why Im trying to get that vacuum          cleaner. Because somebodys going to grab it.   You should just eat fruit.   ???  Hey.  Well, Newmans upstairs visiting Martin.   Youre not going?  Why not?  I dig.   I want my vacuum cleaner! I know you can hear me. Look my mother,          shes going to come and visit me. She sees that rug, shes going          to kill me.  Why would I buy another one when I spent a hundred bucks on this          one?  I dont want a carpet sweeper. They dont do anything.          The carpet sweeper is the biggest scam perpetrated on the American          public since One Hour Martinizing.  I wouldnt set foot in your house.  He looks happy to me.  Okay, Jerry has a friend who has free tickets to the Cayman Islands          for this weekend. Hes not going.   oh oh oh oh oh  I want my vacuum cleaner!  Heey!  A couple of hours ago.  George, I would like to thank you for the greatest four days          I ever spent in my life.  They were shooting the Sports Illustrated swim suit issue right          in the hotel pool.  Not only that but at the hotel they opened up this area on the          beach for nude bathing and all of the Sports Illustrated models went down          there.  I was on the next blanket from Elle McPherson   We played Backgammon in the nude.  Shes a sweet kid.  Oh, you know what? The second day I was there I stepped on a          jellyfish. Now it kind of stung my foot. Thats probably what Rula          was trying to warn you about.  Yeah.  Whats this?  They moved in together?  Phew.  Hey, where ya going?  Um, Id like to but a bunch of us from the islands, well          be getting together.  OH! I got to call her back.  Well, I'm staining my floors and, y'know, I don't want                to get my   The whole apartment. And I'm buying that fake wood wallpaper.                I'm  I can't work with these!  Well, you bought me dishwashing gloves. There's no *fine                touch*...  No, no, these are too thick.  Oooh, is that "Home Alone"?  Ah, the mother lode!  Pay dirt!  I do great.  Yeah, I have a question. What do you know about inter-abdominal                I sure am.  But you *will* use... a retractor.  Mmm-hmm...  I'd love to watch the operation, yeah!  Oh, come on Jerry. You gotta see the operation. They're                gonna cut  ...They'll saw through bone. [makes saw noises while gesturing                over  Ah, there you are. My date stood me up. Listen, will you                guys  Yeah... So c'mon, what d'you say?  Spleenectomy.  Don't ruin it for me, I haven't seen it yet!  C'mon, what d'you say?  C'mon, do you wanna go?  Junior Mints. Do you want one?  I can't see... Psst....  The machine. You want one? Here, take one.  No, they're good!  Just take one.  Hey, this wallpaper is *very* good. My place looks like                a ski   Well, I didn't believe you.  Who's gonna turn down a Junior Mint? It's chocolate, it's                It's very refreshing!  Really?  We could be tried for murder...  You're not gonna say anything, you got that?  You're *not*!!!  Any news?  10-4.  Hello, I'm Kramer.  See you later. [He leaves]  Y'know, art is a great investment.  Mint?  Hey.  You got any pliers?  Newman and I are reversing the peepholes on our door. So                you can see in.  Yeah, so now I can peek to see if anyone is waiting to                jack me with a sock full of pennies.  Our policy is, we're comfortable with our bodies. You know,                if someone wants to help themselves to an eyefull, well, we say,                'Enjoy the show.'  Nobody carries wallets anymore. I mean, they went out with                powdered wigs. Yeah, see here's what you need. Just a couple of                cards and your bankroll.  I'm on the Mexican, whoa ohh, radio...  Hey, Silvio. Yeah, I'm reversing my peephole.  Well, who says I can do any of the things I do in my place?  Well, I... uh, nothing. No, I'll, um, I'll switch it back.  Well, that's good. Because, uh, Newman and I--  Well, yeah.  Who is it?  What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.  What? What are you talking about?  No. No, he can't do that.  Come on, we'll go and talk to him, and we'll straighten                this thing out.  Well, I, uh, I like to think of this as my conference room.                Yeah, it has a more formal atmosphere, you know, with the shelves,                and the furniture.  Oh, well, um, Newman thinks that you, uh, evicted him?  Look... I've known Newman all my life, in the building,                and you're all wrong about him. He's a model tenant. Portly, yes,                but smart as a whip.  All right.  Well, you won't regret it.  So, you're sleeping with Silvio's wife?  Well, why didn't you tell me about this?  Well, it's my business now. Look, I stuck up for you. Man,                if he catches you, we're both out.  Hoooh! Man, that looks like a dead bear.  Man, where did you learn to climb trees like that?  Hey. Oh, uh, yeah. Uh, here are your pliers back....Weak                hinge.  Oh, go down to 88th Street. They're free.  Well, they're hanging from the trees. You know, Newman                found one there yesterday. Man, that guy can climb like a ring-tailed                lemur!  Well, I had some hard candy in there.  Hey, Silvio!  Huh?  Relax, Silvio.  Oh, come on! Hey, Newman didn't even give her that! No,                that's not even a woman's coat. It's a man's!  Yeah.  Oh, lots of 'em.  No.  What about Jerry?  Yeah, sure, he's a celebrity. Oh, yeah, they wear a lot                of furs. They're desperate, insecure people.  Yeah, something like that.  All you have to do is wear the fur so Silvio thinks it's                yours.  Well, then, Newman and I, we get thrown out of the building.  All right, why don't you just take a good, hard look at                what your life will be like if I'm not around?  Oh, come on, man! Well, I'll tell you what, if you do this,                I'll give you that walkman you're always asking about.  And you'll get it back.  All right. Good, thanks, I owe you one.  Oh, hey, and by the way, uh, that walkman was broke when                you gave it to me.  Whoa, whoa. Now, who's this Joe Mayo everyone's talking                about?  I think the chair is a fantastic gift idea. But I never                heard of this Joe Mayo. And frankly, it sounds made up.  All right, Silvio's down there. He's shoveling the walk.                Now, all you gotta do is put this on, you go down to the corner,                you pick up a paper, and you come  There you go.  Ahh....  Jerry, you forgot your purse.  Hey, Silvio, look at Jerry here, prancing around in his                coat with his purse. Yup, he's a dandy. He's a real fancy boy.  All right, you're not fancy!  That must be the man that's sleeping with your wife.  Roger's can't sell chicken around here, we got chicken                places on   Well, I gotta meet Newman at the pet store. Helping him                pick out a  Yea, yea.   What?  Oh the red, its the chicken roaster sign, its right across                my window.  They are shut, oh yea your friend Seth stopped by.   he was fired.  Its killing me, I can't eat, I can't sleep, all I can see                is that   Ah, they have me the heave ho. I don't think that Kenny                Rogers has   Getting some cereal   That looked like milk to me! Jerry my Rods and Cones are                all screwed   Alright listen to me, I got a great idea. You're a heavy                sleeper,   Jerry these are lode baring walls, they're not gonna come                down!  I may have to drive that place out of business.  Like we did in the sixties, takin' in to the streets.  Hey, stay away from the chicken, bad chicken, mess you                up.  Mr. Marbles? He's harmless.  What is that Roger's Chicken? Oh get that outta here.  Well I'm boycotting it.   What is that, hickory?  Really?  Oh stop it.   You should sleep with him.  Oh yea, I like this idea.   That was a close one.  If Jerry finds out I'm hooked on Roger's chicken I'm back                there with   So Heather called?   No, but this is all very exciting.   Of course there's the possibility that you've gone right                out of your  I'd look again. So, how come you didn't call Jerry about                all this?   That's a shame.   Newman, what took you so long, oh hey buddy.   Kenny Roger's? Whew, boy, I hate that place.   Oh hey Elaine stopped by, yea dropped off that Bob Sacamano                hat, oh   Oh you don't want to think about that no sir. Otherwise                I'd have no  Yea, yea go ahead put the banner up doesn't matter to me.                No Jerry! I need that chicken, I gotta have that chicken,                you leave   Oh I got a big problem Jerry!   Kenny? ... Kenny?  Kenny....  So, I noticed you bounced a check at the bodega.  Because Marcelino, he taped it up on his cash register with all          the other bad checks.  That's caged heat.  Hey, Kurt. Taste these eggs.  Yes! These are sweatshop eggs. <Kramer gets up to leave by          climbing over the back of the booth. He loses it and falls on the floor,          then regains his composure and walks out with his napkin still tucked          in his collar.>  Hey. What's up?  Oh? What's she in for?  Well, not here. <Goes into the hallway, comes back in with          a huge bag of chicken feed.>  Well, it's chicken feed. <Slams the bag into Jerry's fridge.>          Cage-free, farm-fresh eggs.  Oh, Jerry loves the morning.  Little Jerry Seinfeld. I named my chicken after you.  Of course it is. I picked it out myself.  Well, that would explain Little Jerry's poor egg production.  Well, this is Little Jerry Seinfeld.  Look, can't you take Jerry's check down?  Well, it comes down if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins the cockfight.  Well, Marcelino, he has cockfights in the back of his store.  So, he says if Little Jerry Seinfeld wins, the check comes down.  Only in The United States.  No, Jerry, it's not what you think it is.  What?  Well, I thought they wore gloves and helmets, you know, like          "American Gladiators."  Well, I left him with Marcelino!  My Little Jerry! <Runs out.>  Well, he's more than O.K., he won!  I couldn't get there in time to stop it, but you should have          seen Little Jerry, Jerry! Flappin' his wings and struttin' his stuff!          He was peckin' and weavin' and bobbin' and talkin' trash! He didn't even          have to touch him! The other rooster ran out of the ring. The whole fight          lasted two seconds.  Five seconds. And Marcelino says he's taking your check down          today.  Hey.  Hey, Little Jerry won his cockfight.  Who?  Well, that's out of the question.  Yeah, if you got a loser. But Little Jerry was born to cockfight!  You know, I think you're jealous.  Never! You hate him because he's doing more with your name than          you ever will! Yah-yah! <Kramer leaves.>  O.K.!  Oh, yeah. He's lookin' good, huh Jerry?  I'm just gonna heat this up. Make a little hot-tub for Little          Jerry.  He's got a big sweat going. <Takes an envelope out of his          pocket.> Oh, this came for you express-mail. It's from your parents.  There's Marcelino. <Marcelino enters the ring holding a huge          white rooster.>  That looks like a dog with a glove on his head.  Little Jerry's going to get his clock cleaned. I gotta get him          outta there.   It's good suspension!   Jerry, I dont think this thing is hooked up right.                Uh, borrow. Its for my friend. Yeah, hell be                buying..   Oh, I dont think so. No, hes an entertainer.                You know, all over the place. Thats where I come in.   Yeah, neighbor. Thats right. Yeah, why dont                we take this boiler out for a shakedown?   No. No, I didnt.   (Up to something) Well, its a test drive, right?                I never drive around here. If Im gonna recommend this car,                I need to see that itll handle my daily  Just a little place I like to call, "Youll see".                No, look, Rick. Im very close to giving this car,                that my celebrity friend is considering, my full endorsement. (Looks                out the window) Oooh, Lets see if  Well, just one more errand and we can head back.   Oh? Well, how much gas do you think is in there right now?                You know, uh, oftentimes, Jerry - he lend me his car and                I find myself in a situation where the car is almost out of gas.                But, for a variety of reasons, I  (In the spotlight, his voice goes high) Well, I make it                up to him in other ways.   Theres still some overlap between the needle and                the slash below the "E".   Oh, Ive been in the slash many times. This is nothing.                Youll get used to it. Just, (Makes a popping sound) get it                out of your mind.   Well, I almost did once, and I blacked out. When I came                to, the car was in a ditch, and the tank was full. I dont                know who did it, and I never got to  Whoop! Whoop!   No, Sir. We are down there.   Yeah, well, alright. Im satisfied. We better get                some gas.   What do you mean?   There was no plan.   What, they drove to a dealership?   You are one sick mama.. I like it.   Yup! Yup!   Cars can go on empty, but not us humans, huh, fella? Ill                get us a couple of Twix bars.   Alright, Ill get ya a Mounds bar. Keep the engine    No, man! Not the gas!   Do you think that thisll make you happy? Cause                it wont!   Listen to me. When that car rolls into that dealership,                and that tank is bone dry, I want you to be there with me when everyone                says, "Kramer and that  Its good to have you back, Stan.   No time!   Hey!   Oh, it broke off, baby! Woo, hoo, hoo!   Well, thats a weird thing to say..   Yeah, yeah. I wonder.. hmm.   Whew! Well, I think we stopped.   Oh, yeah. (Getting out of the car) Well, Ill think                about it..   Fungus.  I would. I always open medicine cabinets.  Big mistake.  Fungi.  Fungi.  Oh yeah, Im here to pick up my friend George Costanza.  Oh yeah.  Oh. Kramer. Pleasure.  Sister Roberta gave it to me.  I think she liked me.  *Liked* me.  No. I think I picked up on a vibe.  Yeah, Jerry Im telling you I have this power. And                I have no control   Hey.  I told you.  I told you she liked me.  Sister Roberta.  She told me. She said shes never had a man stir up                all of these   Um, you wanted to see me Father?  I know what this is about Father. I didnt do anything.                I just   Kavorka?  I dont understand.  Help me Father. Help me.  Hey.  Ive got the Kavorka Jerry.  The lure of the animal. Im dangerous.  The priests theyre helping me. I just bathed in vinegar.  Keep away Jerry. Keep away.  How you doing?  Yes, Yes. It worked. Sister Roberta Ive still got                time to catch   You dont?  Yeah yeah.  You sure you dont want me to take my clothes off?                (beat) Ill do it!  Well, why dont you take your clothes off?  (debonair smile) Well, itd be our little secret.  Are you getting the eyes? 'Cause they're brown. (beat)                Or, really,  She and Jerry were a big thing, like Abe Lincoln and Mary                Todd.  Oh yeah, they're like this (holds up two fingers together).  Why, what's the difference?  Well, you know... I, uh... have many relationships.  Yeah!  George, you gonna buy a painting?  (immediately) Yeah.  Right. (Elaine giggles) Oh boy... okay, who wants a dog?

All right, let's go.  Hey buddy. Remember me?  Yeah, I'm just here to do my part. What's your name darling?  I'm the real Peterman.  Relax man. There's enough juice here to keep us all fat                and giggley.  I have a right to be here. These are my fans. Hey you're                hurting my elbow.  So get this. Peterman has his henchmen forcefully eject                me from the book signing like I'm some kind of a maniac.  What's the matter with you?  No, no, no. Don't give me that. I know you. Something's                wrong. What is it.  What did you do?  Don't you know you're not supposed to poke around down                there.  (high pitched voice) "Well women do it." I'll                tell you what. I'll pick you up a sundress and a parasol and you                can just (high pitched voice) sashey your pretty little self around                the town square.  Listen to me.

People want to know the                stories behind the stories.  I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get a pizza bagel and                desert.  Bite-size Three Musketeers. Just like the real Peterman                eats.  No. I eat those. I'm the real Peterman.  Talk to me.  Understand?  Hey Jerry. What is this? Lady Gillette? What's going on?  What are you doing to yourself?  You can't keep this up. Don't you know what's going to                happen? Everytime you shave it, it's going to come in thicker and                fuller and darker.  Is it? Look at this.  (high pitched voice) Look at it! Look at it! And it's all                me. I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.  Won't it? Or is it already starting to happen?  Comming up on the right, if you glance up you can just                make out my bedroom window. It's the one that's covered in chicken                wire.  (over the speaker) Well that's your opinion.  Forget it. Okay Newman's postal route is around here somewhere.  Ahh. Everyone just settle down. We have three hours left                on this thing, and I can't drive and argue with you rubes all at                the same time.  Jerry you're a minor celebrity. If you go on this thing,                it could create a minor stir. Bring that girlfriend of your and                I'll only charge to 60 bucks.  All right, I've got to hose the puke off the floor of the                bus.  Yeah.  Yeah there are a few seats still available.  Well, if they don't mind sitting in the back.

Is this a joke?  (gets back on the bus, yelling) Well maybe I will take                it up with Consumer Affairs.  (looking at a map) I don't know. (over the speaker) Uh,                no more questions.  Don't worry. I've got a good feeling about this dump.  I don't know where the tops are.   Jerry what's the matter?

Well, if you've got needs and abilities that's a pretty good          combination.  There are no delicatessens under Communism.  Well, because the meats are divided into a class system. You          got Pastrami and Corned Beef in one class and Salami and Bologna in another.          That's not right.  Well, you know, if you're in the Politburo, maybe.  Ho ho ho ho A racing car set!

If you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting,              you're wasting your time. I am not Jerry, under any circumstances,              doing any inserting in that area.  No.              No. I'm gonna stay home. I want to be close to my home base in case              there's any news from the front.

It's like they chopped off your arms and legs,          dipped you in plastic, and screwed you back all together, and stuck you          on a pedestal. It's really quite exquisite.   Rinitze.   It's this itch. I was watching TV without my shirt on, and one          my couch cushion didn't have any fabric on it.   Real Boss!     How did they get your face?   Hey, Elaine scratch my back.   Come on, one lap around.   It will be a funky adventure.   Jerry, how about you?   I'm going home to spatula.   Madam, I pray you're not toying with me.   Oh, all right.   Hey.

Ohh! She's a maestro. The crisscross.          The figure eight, strummin' the ol' banjo, and this wild, savage free-for-all          where anything can happen.   Is that Elaine mannequin still there?   Hey Jerry, I saw your girlfriend was in here before.   Yep. Sat down, had herself a piece of pie.   What else?   What am I supposed to say?   I lost it two days ago. I've been faking it so I wouldn't hurt          her feelings.   I'll let her down easy. All right.   Uh, well, there's someone else.   Yeah, yeah, yeah...   Her.   Yeah, there she is. That's my gal.   Now Olive, look, I'm sorry.   Well, it's a style.   Hey. Well, bad news, boys. My life is over. My girlfriend's                movin' away.  Jerry, where have you been?  Downtown.  Yeah. I don't know if I can handle one of these long-distance                relationships.  I don't know.  Oh! Jeez! Well, you've got a maid. It's a whole different                world downtown-- different Gap, different Tower Records, and she's                a 646.  Listen. Heads up, Elaine. I'm gonna have to stop by later                and pick up a fax.  No. At your apartment.  Well, now what are we gonna do? (to Jerry) See?

I miss her already.  Well, I signed up for a food delivery service, Now We're                Cookin'. That's a play on words. You know, they're faxing me the                menus from some restaurants.  Well, all of them. It's the deluxe package.  Well, it better not. Paid for the whole year. So, should                I pick those up later?  Ah!  Madeline and I are watching Quincy together. Jerry, you                know this comes on at the same time here as it does there?

The distance, the longing, the distance, the-- you know, I didn't                realize it, but I'm a needy person.  Oh, yeah? So what am I supposed to do, be more like you?                All sealed up in here, emotionally unavailable, paying scrubwomen                for sexual favors! No! Jerry, I won't be like you! Never! I'll never                be like you!   Hey, buddy, don't say no!  I went down to Madeline's. I told her, "You gotta                move, or it's over."  I think it's over. We had a big fight, she threw me out,                I started walkin', and now I'm lost downtown! I don't have any money.                I don't recognize anybody.

Nice to meet you"  (like rainman)"Yeah! heading home."  "Yeaheum ... You're not doing too bad yourself"  (whose voice has returned to normal)" THE VELVET FOG!!!!"  "Well...He's singing at a benefit and I'm gonna be                sitting at his table."  "I'm a guest of honor."  "Well this afternoon I shared a cab with this...a                hum..Deensfrei."  "Yeah! well ..that's the guy .He's organizing the                dinner."  "Well, because we hit it off and he was very impressed                with what I do."  "Well apparently I do something 'cause I'm sitting                at the head table with Mr. Mel Torm  "Ehmm ..These are my vertical leap training shoes."  "Yeah! yeah! right after I left the Y."  "I'm going to try and find some candy. You want some?"  "What kind?"  "There's no candy around here. hey! Jimmy."  "Whooo!"  "What!"  (Keamer's voice starts slurring again) "Yeah! My lips                swollen?"  "No No I've been living alone a long time now."  "Hey! Got the new Penthouse"  " Ah! here here Listen...Dear Penthouse, I want to                tell you about   Hello, boys and girls.  Yeah. Hey listen, I uh, I need a picture of you, buddy.  Well, I'm uh, I'm putting everybody's picture up in the lobby          So everyone will know everybody's name. See, people are gonna          Imagine walking by someone on the floor, and you say "Hey,          (to Elaine) You know your eyeliner's smudged a little. Why do          (surprised) Hey, hey hey hey. Hello!  (evasive) Ohh, nothing, nothing.  Oh, I, I need a pen.  Well, I'm making out my will. Oh, I got a big slice of dough          You got that straight.  Oh, come on, Jerry. If everybody knew everybody, we wouldn't          Well, I'm gonna get your picture, and you're gonna participate          Yeah.  Why?  Hey! Jerry!  I told you I was gonna get it.  (holding the picture away from Jerry) Aagh. No no no no no.  Oh, hello.  (shaking hands) Yeah.  (points) You know, I really like that hairdo.  (interrupting) Oh, no no no. You don't wanna do that. No no.          No, no. you'd be a damn fool to change it. It's very becoming.  Hey! (indicating photos) So what d'you think? You like it?  Well, it's not a beauty contest. It's just a way for people to          Hey...  ...Steve. (to Jerry) Ah, you see?  (interested) Well, how do you do?  (keen) What was I telling you? Isn't this nice?  Hey.  For what?  You should be thanking me for liberating you from your world          of  Yeah.  What's up?  Oh.  Hey, don't you worry buddy. I made double prints.  Oh, hey, Jack. How you doing?  Hi.  What, again? You took one this morning.  I know but I... (waves toward the interior of his apartment)          (leaning to look round Kramer) Wendy here?  No no no. She changed her hairstyle, (pulls a face) it's   Oh yeah, yeah, great. (calling after the guy) And get some of          Hey.  Hi.  Ooh, I like that.  Stefanie. 2-G.  Yeah yeah. Well uh, you know, I'd invite you in, but uhm... you          What are you doing this for? Look at you..  But you don't have to do this! This guy is waiting in my                house.  It's a one-time fee. A hundred and fifty bucks. Why live                like this?!  Oh, so what are you gonna do? You gonna wait for the cable                companies to resolve their dispute? They're gonna be in court for                years.  (Sarcastic) Oh, oh, the paper..  Oh, God, you're so naive! All the cable companies care                about is the "Big Mammoo." (Jerry wacks the TV) Oh, look                at you! You're banging things..  Can you hear yourself? Can, can, do you know what you're                saying?!  It's not illegal.  Well, yeah.  (Holding the rabbit ears) Look, will you at least let me                bring the guy over? He's an amazing man. He's a Russian immigrant.                He escaped the Gulag. He's  Yeah. He's intense, man.  Oh, you're not gonna get caught. Look, let me get him.                Man, it's the nineties, it's Hammer time! Come on, just let me get                him.  No problem. Yeah, you'll have the whole thing installed                by the time you get back.  No, no, now look now, Jerry, Jerry, it's no risk. I swear.                The Mets have seventy-five games on cable this year..  You won't regret it. (Jerry mutters some more, Kramer rubs                his hands together in anticipation, then starts dancing around with                a reluctant Jerry) Jerry's  Jerry, I had to tell them. I had to. I had no choice. They                were onto the scam from the very beginning.  No! Jerry! (The FBI agents open fire. Jerry's gunned down                by a hailstorm of bullets. Kramer leans next to a fallen Jerry,                cupping Jerry's head in his  We're putting in cable.  Oh, we have to do this now.  Which one?  Oh, they're Soviet Cable guys.  Oh yeah.. it's all authorized, yeah.  Elaine, do you know how booked up this guy is? Now, if                I send him away now, it's gonna take Jerry months to get him back..                He won't like that.  (Snaps his fingers) Anatoly! (The Russians get to work                on command. To Elaine) Look, it's gonna take a few minutes.. Then,                you and the gals can take a  (Flirting with a female guest) Yeah, I eat the whole apple.                The core, stem, seeds, everything.  Yeah, yeah. Well, you know, there are many differences                between American and Soviet cultures that you're not aware of. See,                in Russian, the cable guy,  (Trying to break up the fight) Uh.. Excuse me..  Don't be a fool.  (Pops his head into Jerry's apartment) Hey, come on over,                Dr. Zhivago's on cable in five minutes.. I'm making popcorn! (Leaves)  That Gendason, what a jerk. I'm never playing golf with him again.  Steve Gendason.  Well, I met him on the course a couple of years ago. Yeah. Played          with him a lot. But today was it! We're on the fifteenth hole, ya, he's          beating me by a couple of strokes. Then, he's about to hit his second          shot, when, he picks up the ball and CLEANS it.  Umph, sorry! But the rules clearly state that you cannot clean          the ball unless it's on the green. The rules are very clear about that.          Ya, so I penalized him a stroke.   He LOST IT! We almost came to blows. We were face to face like          a manager and an umpire like this . . kara a pukka ba ya ka ba . . .   A rule is a rule. And let's face it. Without rules there's chaos.          Turn on the TV.  I'm puttin it on  Jerry . . .   Yeah, but maybe he was so mad from the penalty stroke that he          murdered the dry cleaner.  Jerry, Jerry they found a tee.   A golf tee. In the dry cleaner.  Listen to this, "If a player cleans his ball during the          play of a hole accept on the putting green he shall incur a penalty of          one stroke. " That's a rule, Jerry.  Because that's the way I weas raised. You know when I was growing          up I had to be in bed every night by nine o'clock. And if I wasn't, well          I don't have to tell you what happened.   You know he talked about Pinkus on the course?   Oh yeah, he said he brought a pair of pants into Pinkus' and          they came back stained with some kind of dry cleaning fluid. And Pinkus          denied responsibility. You see he was very upset with Pinkus.   Yeah, but maybe I pushed him over the edge.   Poor Pinkus, poor little Pinkus.  Oh, I love curls.  All right, I'll see you later.  Genderson's.  It's weighing on my conscience.   Yeah, this is Kramer. I got Genderson in the car. He wants to          see his fish. I'm taking him to see his fish. So tell the police to back          off.   My name is Kramer. You know who I am dammit!   I thought we would blend in.  we would have had all that bridge traffic.   Hey, boys and girls. I need you both to sponsor me in the AIDS          walk.  Yeah, yeah, so...git-git...<gestures to Elaine to sign the          form.>  Well, if I didn't do something I wouldn't be able to live with          myself.  I tell ya, there's some people, they just wear a ribbon and they          think they're doin' something? Not me. I talk the talk, and I walk the          walk, baby. <gets up> I'll be right back.  Are you still on the pill?  I'll tell ya, I think birth control should be discussed in an          open forum.   But wasn't that taken off the market?  I read it in   Hey, I'm in tip-top shape. Better than you!  Yeah, well I'm walking for charity, what are you doing?  It's a poker game...<yells to the crowd> And I'm kickin'          some serious butt!  Oh, you gotta be kiddin'! You see those two ladies I got showin'?          Do they look scared?!   Ah, you're lucky you're walkin' out of here with a pair of pants          on!  AIDS walk! That's a cake walk. <George enters.> Hey!  Uh, no thanks.  No.  I have to?  See, that's why I don't want to.   You know what you are? You're a ribbon bully. <Walks away.>  Oh, I don't wear the ribbon.  Yeah, I'm against AIDS. I mean, I'm walking, aren't I? I just          don't wear the ribbon.  This is America! I don't have to wear anything I don't want to          wear!  Jerry, now calm down, it's okay. I'm sorry. I didn't want to          wake you up! Y'know, I was watching "Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"          and I - y'know, I wanted to get some popcorn, and I, uh...I used the spare          keys that you gave me to come into your apartment to get your popper.  It's just me.  Forgot the popper... <goes to the kitchen, grabs the popper,          drops the lid, juggles it around, then exits.>  What does it look like I'm doing? What?  Alright, alright...  Sorry.   My drain's all clogged up! <Comes out of the bathroom in a          towel, covered in soap suds.>  Hey, Jerry! How are ya? I thought you were going to the movies.  What?  Oh, come on!  What, what, I thought you went to the movies!  Now how was I supposed to know it was going to be sold out?  What point?  Just give me another chance!  I'm asking you!  You're joking.  It's not going to happen again!  No, no, no, it's o.k. I don't care about the keys. It's my fault.          I gave the keys away with my stupidity. I broke "the covenant of          the keys."  I don't want the keys back! No, I'm glad the way things turned          out. I was clingin' to those keys, man! Like a branch on the banks of          a raging river. And now I have let go. And I'm free...to go with the current.          To float. (To Jerry) And I thank you.  I don't want the keys! <Jerry tries to force the keys on Kramer,          but Kramer refuses.>   Now, one more thing - I would like   That's right.  Yeah. Yeah, I think it would be for the best.  Say yes! Yes, George. Yes!  Well, you can get 'em back.  Because you see, George, having the keys to Jerry's apartment?          That kept me in a fantasy world. Every time I went over to his house,          it was like I was on vacation. Better food, better view, better TV. And          cleaner? Oh - much cleaner. That became my reality. I ignored the squalor          in my own life because I'm looking at life, you see, through Jerry's eyes.          I was living in twilight, George. Living in the shadows. Living in the          darkness...like you.  Oh, yeah. I can barely see you, George.  I yearn.   Oh, yes. Yes, I yearn. Often, I...I sit...and yearn. Have you          yearned?  O.K., like what? No, tell me! Do you have a job?  You got money?  Do you have a woman?  Do you have any prospects?  You got anything on the horizon?  Do you have any action at all?  Do you have any conceivable reason for even getting up in the          morning?  George, it's time for us to grow up - and be men. Not little          boys.  I'm goin' to California. You know, I got the bug.  No, the acting bug. Ever since I was in that Woody Allen movie.  I know, I know, but man! I never felt so alive! Now, are you          coming with me?  Alright, suit yourself. But let's keep this between us - we're          key brothers now. <Gets up to leave.>  And then, the evil ogre took back the magical keys from the handsome          young prince.  Yes! And then the handsome young prince was cast out into the          cruel, cruel world.  Oh, he's cold.  Yeah, yeah...that'd be funny. (To driver) Hey, you can drop me          here!  Well, you know, I gotta be goin' now.  What do you think, junior? You think these hands have been soakin'          in Ivory liquid? <mimics choking somebody>  So, how long you been drivin' this thing?  Well, nothin's sexier than a woman behind the wheel of a semi.  You know, I always wanted to drive the big rigs. I used to watch          those commercials during the reruns of Gomer Pyle.   Really?  Yeah.  Oh, good morning, Miss Brown.  Oh, I'm uh, Steven Snell.  Steven.  Oh - I'm familiar with it.  Hey.   (Laughing) What is that, a new bit?   I'll do it.   Yeah, I love going to the country.   (Holding camera) Get in a little closer. I can't see the                screen  It might be time to just let her go, Frank. She's worked  Oh yeah, I'll take good care of her. (Rips out the screen                door)  Yeah.   Oh, I'm putting up Frank's screen door. This beauty's got    (Closing door) The cool evening breezes of Anytown, USA.                Let's see  (Spraying his flowers) Hello, neighbor.   Oh, you gotta mulch. You've got to.   (Ringing his wind chimes) Right after the fireworks.   Hey, buddy!   She's really gotten to you, hasn't she?   Simple. You let out one emotion, all the rest will come  Yeah, well, she... had one, too. (George enters)  (Baseball flies at Kramer and hits him) That's it, that's                it! I  Look what they did. Look what they did to my house! I turn                my back  I love you, too, buddy, and George--   Listen, when I give you the signal, I want you to turn                this  I'll yell, uh, 'Hoochie mama!'   On the signal, George. On the signal.   Now! Now, George! Turn on the faucet! George, turn on the  Joey Zanfino and some of the neighborhood kids. They  Oh, no. I'm fine. Serenity now. Serenity now. Serenity                now.  Serenity! (He exits)  Serenity now, serenity now...   Geez! Jerry, I didn't here you come in. Yeah, the children,  Well, that's odd, 'cause I feel perfectly at peace with                the  (crashing and banging in his apartment) Serenity now!   (Crashing and banging around) Serenity nooooowwwww!   (Leaving) George, you listen to me. I owe ya one.   Bad news, my friend.  Sendrax.  Two and a half points.  Hey, I told ya.  It's all manipulated with junk bonds. You can't win.  Hey, I don't care. I'm just telling you to (yelling) get                rid of that stock, now!  Sell it, just say I'm selling!  You know, I can't believe you put your money in that Sendrax.                And you could've invested in my roll-out tie dispenser.  Okay, you're in a restaurant. You've got a very big meeting                coming up.  You just (makes noise) tear it off, and you got a new one                right here. Then you're gone.  (Looking at map) Hey, where.. where are you going? You                gonna take a trip? The map.. what..  Hey, can I use your place? I got a bunch of friends coming                over this weekend.  Well, it's just some people I met at a rock concert.  Do you mind if they use your bed? (Jerry give him a look)                'Cause they're really good people, Jerry. I'm telling you. You know,                they're anarchists.  How much are you down altogether?  Wow.  Oh, look at this one by the bus stop. Jerry, come here.                Take a look at this.  What a body. Yeeaahh.. that's for me.  I'm gonna go down there and try and talk to her. (leaves)  Take me where? Where?  What am I gonna say?  Well, I'm not an idiot.  Then we're cool.  (Patting George on the shoulder) He's a hell of a guy.  Habla espanol?  Como se dice.. waterbed?  You got anything to drink? Agua?  Let me get a glass of water. (Heads tward the sink)  His cat's gone.  ..You know, cats run away all the time. You know, my aunt,                she had a cat. Ran away. Showed up three years later.. you never                know. They got things in  The wire was sticking out.. (Fits the two broken pieces                together) Yeah.  You oughta get that wire fixed. (They go to leave) I got                the door. (Shuts the door, the broken lamp falls to the floor)  Hey.  It's been a week. It's up to the cat now.  Oh? How do you figure?  Why was I in charge of closing the door?  So!  Let me talk to him.  ..The busboy's coming! The busboy's coming!  Yeah. I just buzzed him in. He's on his way up..  No, he's not going to do anything. I guarantee it.  Antonio. In here!  Hey, what made you think you could touch that                awning?  So how we doin' on time?  Will you relax?!  This is the best way to go!  George, there's no traffic at this time. Now,                come on, man...  If anything, we'll probably get there early.                I'll have a chance to   Duty.  No, I dunno how much duty is.  I still like to stop at the duty free shop.  How does it look on your side? [Pause while                George just stares at him] We'll get there...  Look at you! You run like a girl! Run like                a man! Lift your knees!  No, there it is, right there-- 133... and                it's canceled.  Ok, c'mon... let's go check over at the ticket                counter.  Did you see that guy?  That guy.. He was just...  [still lost] I know that guy...  They're on a different flight. They're scheduled                to land in a half hour, only at Laguardia.  Where do I know that guy from?  It's Grossbard!  When I lived on Third avenue and 18th street                20 years ago, I had this roommate who was *always* behind in his rent.                Then one month,   No, I'm gonna turn around... I'm gonna get                that guy...  What?  Let's go. Listen to the bell, Grossbard--              it tolls for thee.  Grossbard's plane leaves in ten minutes. I                *still* got time to   Gimme your credit card.  Just gimme the card, don't ask me any questions.  I'm gonna buy a ticket-- I'm gonna get on                that flight.  No, I'm not gonna use the ticket! I'm gonna                get my money, I'll get   Look, I got Super Savers! C'mon.  She talked me in to it-- she said it was the                best deal.

Come on, I'll rub some on yours.  No. (George leaves for the tomatoes)  I'm gonna go see if there are any girls on the beach. Elaine,                you  Yo yo ma.  We're gonna be right there.  Maybe she's trying to create a buzz.  You know, get some good word of mouth goin'.  Deh-deh-deh-deh- (Jane exits) All right, show's over. I'm                goin'  Hey, hey, hey! Look at what I got!  Yeah, and they're fresh! Right out of the ocean.  I know, it's great. And I saw Jane topless. (Jerry shows                that  Yeah, I saw Jane topless. Well, we all saw her.  I guess she was hot.  No, no, she got up, walked around...  Of course. She's got a great body, buddy. All right, I'm                gonna go  Rachel, aren't you gonna have any?  You mean you've never tasted lobster?  Wow. You're so pious. I really respect that. You know when                you  No, I got 'em in the ocean.  Well, I found this rope and I kept tugging on it, and all                these  Take it easy. There's plenty of lobsters in the ocean for  Ahhh! (Falls to floor as he sees the baby)  Looking for this? (Holding up lobster)  Well, I thought you might wind up around here.  I'm afraid I couldn't do that.  Well, that wouldn't be kosher.  Nah, I'm sorry, honey. Not on my watch.  Heyahhh!  I didn't know you could cook.  You'd regret it for the rest of your life.  Wonder what's goin' on.  Well, they're in...  The MACANAW PEACHES ,Jerry , the MACANAW PEACHES!!!!  Yeah Yeah I split a case with Newman..I waited all year                for this.. Oooh this is fantastic..  Come on ,Just take a taste  Come on JUST TASTE!!!  HE..YA. AYA. AYYYYYAAAAA!!!!  Jerry , this is a miracle of nature that exists for a brief                period. It's like the Aurora Borealis.  What?  Flea bites?  You got a dog?  Well, that is strange.  Don't sweat it buddy...I used to have fleas.  What do you mean?...  I left a Macanaw peach in your refrigerator.  Toxic gas!!!  An hour and a half!!! I was reading a manuscript, I just                couldn't put it down.  Now that you mention it , a little woozy.  I'm not going back in there!!  I left it on the coffee table or somethin'  Well I thought it was so your parents wouldn't walk in                while you're with a girl.  Well I don't know . I was in the bathroom , the kitchen...  Jerry, I had some milk, I made a sandwich. I got to get                out of the building.  Oh! yeah.  Well it's a story about love, deception, greed, lust and...unbridled                enthusiasm.  Well , that's what led to Billy Mumphrey's downfall.  You see Elaine, Billy was a simple country boy. You might                say a cockeyed optimist,  ah! Here we go.  May I..( pointing her food)  what is this?  I can't taste this.  This food ,it has no taste......nothin' I'm gettin' nothin'...(                realizes) It must be the toxic gas  Newman ,Let me have a bite of your Macanaw..  Come on ,c'mon i need to taste it. ( takes his peach).....Nothin'                , Can't even taste a Macanaw.  Waited all year and I can't even taste it..  ya....Yes!....Yes! it's back I can taste again. ( to a                passerby) Hey! What's the date today?  Fifteenth , Yes last day for the Macanaws. I can still    ( fake laugh ) Look Hubert. It's the mailman. You remember                the mailman don't you.  (Correcting) No, they're not cloning sheep. It's the same                sheep! I saw Harry Blackstone do that trick with two goats and a                handkerchief on the old Dean  (Answering phone) Yeah, Go! Wha.. really? Yeah, ok. Yeah!                Bye. (Hangs up) Great news! Yeah, the strike has been settled. I'm                going back to work.  Yeah, H&H Bagels. That's where I worked.  Yeah. Look, see. I still have my business card. (Pulls                it out, hands it to Elaine) Yeah, we've been on strike for 12 years.  Yeah, well, H&H wouldn't let us use their bath room                while we were picketing. It put a cramp on our solidarity.  Yeah, 5.35 an hour. And that's what they're paying now.  Now you know who to thank for that!.. Alright, I've got                to go. (Heads for the door)  Jerry, I didn't want you to know I was out of work. It's                embarrassing! (Leaves) (Scene ends)  All right, everybody! I'm back!  Cosmo Kramer.. strikes over.  Huh.. wha- Didn't any of the guys come back?  Oh, man. Makes you wonder what it was all for..  Alright! Toss me an apron, let's bagel! (Takes off his                coat, puts it in the display case, then turns to see a plate full                of bagels.) What are those?  (Picks one up, he's mesmerized) I never thought I'd live                to see that..  Ah, gentlemen.. bagels on the house!  Oh, fantastic! (Jerry and George both pick out a bagel)                It felt so good to get my hands back in taht dough.  No, I didn't make these bagels. (Jerry and George both                take a bite) Yeah, they're day-olds. The homeless won't even touch                them. (Jerry and George  What's Festivus?  Frank invented a holiday? He's so prolific!  Well, just tell me everything, huh?  What happened to the doll?  That musta been some kind of doll.  Is there a tree?  Frank, this new holiday of yours is scratching me right                where I itch.  No. (To manager of H&H) Ah, listen, Harry, I need the                23rd off.  But it's Festivus.  You know you're infringing on my right to celebrate new                holidays..  Well, it's going to be! Because I'm going back on strike.                Come on Elaine. (Takes of his apron, and goes for his coat) It's                a walk out!  What? You're siding with management?!  (Interrupting) Scab! Scab! (pointing at Elaine) Scab!  Well, Happy Festivus.  There's a big dinner Tuesday night at Frank's house - everyone's                invited.  (Shocked at her ugliness, he stammers) Hello.  Protect Festivus! Hey, no bagels, no bagels, no bagels,                (Continues to chant)  (From a phone booth right outside the store) Elaine, you                should get out of there. I sabotaged the bagel machine last night.                It's going down.  You've been warned.  Hey! How do you like your bagels now?!  (Shocked by the way Elaine looks) Yama - Hama! It's fright                night!  And?  Yeah.  Oh, hello.  Ah-huh.  Ahh.. I don't know who you really are, but I've seen Jerry's                girlfriend, and she's not you. You're much better looking - and                like, a foot taller.  Oh, he's a tomcat.  Hey! Happy Festivus, everyone! (Hugs George, and jumps                up and down) Hee, hee, hee!  (Finishing the story) I told them I was just about to see                you.. It's a Festivus miracle!  Uh.. that's right.  Another Festivus miracle!  Uh-oh. Oh, gee, Frank, I'm sorry. I gotta go. I have to                work a double shift at H&H.  Well, I caved. I mean, I really had to use their bathroom.                Frank, no offence, but this holiday is a little (makes a series                of noises) out there.  Thank - you! (Gets his coat, and leaves)  What?  Well, don't press the panic button. I'm sure that we can still          salvage some sauce..  (Taking some of Jerry's clothing over to the kitchen) I see..  Well, why don't you do your material?  (Looking up, sighs) Well, you better get to work.  (Looks up) I'm salvaging the sauce. What's the matter with you?          (Eats the bread)  (Moving out into the living room) Jerry, why don't you do a bit          on Styrofoam?  Well, uh.. (Starts to impersonate Jerry's act) "What is          this stuff? Why do we need this stuff?.. And why do they make it so small..?"  It's all attitude.. (Makes a humorous face - mocking Jerry's)  Look, it's personalized. (Holds it up, reading) "The Costanzas"  Well, maybe your father would be interested in that.  (Interested) Oh yeah? Well, maybe I'll go out there and knock          a few balls around with him. You know, show him a thing or two..  So, what's your game? What do you like to play?  No, nothing doing. Let's, you and me, play a game of straight          pool.. hmm?  Yeah, now and then - you know how it is..  I'll break.  (Explaining why they are doing so bad) Well, we're still, uh,          learning the subtleties of the table.  (Judging up his next move) As soon as the game is over..  Eleven, corner pocket. (Pulls back on his stick, accidentally          crashing it into the window)  Well, listen, if you bring 'em by, maybe we could interest you          in a game of pool.. Yeah, Frank here - he's got his own billiard room.  A billiard room.  (Confused) What?  (Snaps) The Place To Be!  Oh, yeah?  Really?  That's good thinking.  Now this is remarkable. I'm lounging, and yet, my pants remain          perfectly creased.  Come on. Are you sure?  Alright, come on Frank. It's your shot.  (Like a professional) Well, that's because you don't know how          to follow through correctly.  Right here, come on, I'll show you.. (Gets behind Frank, holding          the pool stick with him) Take hold of your stick.. alright, bring it back          slowly..  Yeah.. (Sizes up his next shot. His stick jams into the window          as he draws back) See? This is no good.. (Looks around the room. His sights          fall on the Maestro's baton) Hey, the baton. (Chalks it up) I got a hunch,          fat man, I can't miss. (Measures up his shot) 13 in the side pocket. (Does          just that) Giddy-up. (Moves around to the other side of the board, judging          his next move) Six in the corner. (Hits it in) This table's mine. (A series          of Kramer's plays are displayed, and, on the last ball of the game..)          You know where it's going..  (Taking his pair off, he inspects them) Aw, beautiful!  (handing Jerry & George a flyer) Good morning, gentlemen.  (removing his coat) Yeah, well, it's the latest offering from          the Alex  (sits beside Jerry) Well, you should smell it now. We fixed up          the  (lighting his pipe) Well, it's a rare archival print. (jumps          as his  Har-harwood, Jerry. He was the assistant wardrobe man on Spartacus.          Some  Well, why go to a fine restaurant, when you can just stick something          in  Well, he's using his connections in the Mayor's office, to uh,          get the  Well, he did. You know, after that, he had a nervous breakdown?          Had to  Yeah, but he's doing a lot better now. I've taken him under my          wing.  But he still needs all of our support. Now, when he gets here          treat him  Oh, hey Lloyd, hey buddy. (gets up and shakes Lloyd's hand)  (slaps Lloyd on the shoulder) Sit down. (sits himself)  Yeah well, he's doing fine, George.  Yes, yes. We shall all try a piece and tell you how delicious          it is. (he  Jerry, Jerry. Lloyd says it's no problem. He's capable of locating          the  Mmm, delicious. This is delicious. Mmm.  The Alex was built in nineteen twenty-two, during the golden          era of  Yes, yes I am. The icing on the cake would be getting that landmark  Lloyd Braun can do anything he puts his mind to. He's fine, Jerry.          (to  (emphatic) You're not crazy. Jerry does wear glasses. He just          forgot  Yeah.  (slapping Jerry on the back) Ah, he loved it.  Yeah, yeah. It's being repaired.  Yeah, put these glasses on.  Yeah, well Lloyd, he's gonna be here any minute now.  Well, he thinks you wear those.  They're from the lost and found at the Alex.  Oh. Okay. So he'll just think that the two of you didn't sit          with him on  Hey, Jerry, look who's here.  Yeah, let's all enjoy a chew, huh?  Oh, boy.  Now see, this is what the holidays are all about. Three buddies,          sitting  Hey, Jerry, you know, Lloyd wants to do you a favour.  No, sure sure, he wants to. It's very kind of you. Yeah, Jerry,          he  Yeah?  Oh, baby, what was that all about, huh?  Yeah, you uh, really missed a show, buddy. Wooh, ba-boom,  Mr Har-harwood. Well, what an unexpected surprise to have you          back at  Well, let's look in lost and found, shall we?  Brown?  Uh, yeah. Ah, well if they're not in the box, I'm sure they'll          turn up  Jeez! What happened to your car, buddy?  Wow. Well, don't you sweat it. You can use my car any time you          want to.  No kidding.  Yeah, merry Christmas.  What, he's not here yet?  Listen, I'm gonna need those glasses.  They're Geoffrey Haarwood's.  (proffering) Here, try this pair.  (clapping Jerry on the back) Oh yeah, he's all ready to go.  Oh yeah, she called a little earlier. She's coming over to check          out  Uh, yeah.  Wh...wh...wh... what's the problem here?  No, no, no, no, no. This man is not insane. Now there's nothing          wrong  No, no, no, no. I'll show you. (slams a bill down on the counter)          One  Mmm, doesn't that smell good, huh?  Yeah, here we go, yeah. (he takes a big bite) Mmm, oh. That's          delicious.  Uhm, interesting texture. It's chewy. (he half-coughs, half-retches)          I  Look, honey, I know you're trying to get Lloyd to notice you,          but this  Yeah, well, I'm sorry, but the Alex is a family theatre, not          one of your  Mr Hararwood. Found your glasses.  Ah, the I.P.M.P.C.W.  Is that from Henry the Eighth?  Well, you know, we're screening that tonight at the Alex. Do          you think  (an idea occurs) You don't say.  You're really helping me out with this, buddy. Kids are gonna          be so  Remember, you're a king, you must project a Royal bearing.  Ahh, Mr Haarwood. Well, you certainly know how to dress for a          premiere.  Oh, he ran away.  I need to talk to you.  Oh, tell me about it.  Hey! Anybody up for Lorenzo's pizza?  Oh, yeah? Huh. (Turns to George) Hey, George! Pizza? Yum,                yum!  Hey.  Alright, so there I am at Lorenzo's - loading up my slice                of the fixin's bar.. garlic, (imitates the shaking of garlic onto                a pizza) and what-not.. mmm,  Oh yeah, and they're just as mean as he was! So, I make                a move to the door, you know, (makes a noise) they block it! So,                I lunged for the bathroom.  Because I'm still holding the garlic shaker.. Yeah.. like                this (grabs Jerry's peper shaker, and demonstrates) I'm only showing                eight fingers.  That's their secret sign! See, Van Buren, he was teh eighth                President.. (Holds up 8 fingers) They thought I was a former Van                B. Boy!  And they made it their sign, because, Van Buren, our 8th                President, was the man they most admired.  You know, if you like that one, I got more.. what are you                looking for? Romance? Comedy? Adventue? .. Erotica? (Clicks his                tongue)  My whole lot?  (Thinks) 1500 dollars.  (Excited) Done!  Okay.. (To Elaine) Well, I, Uh.. I like to work in the                evenings.. (Elaine slumps back, and covers her head in misfortune)  Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then                and there that I need to return this pair of pants. So, I'm off                to the store.  Well, nothing. His part of the story is done. (Elaine covers                her face with her hands - showing her difficulty coping with Kramer)                So I'm waiting for the  Well, I don't know if I lost track of time - or what, but                the next think I knew..   No, I slipped - and fell in the mud. Ruining the very pants                I was about to return.  Well, I guess I was..  Elaine, are you listening?! I didn't even get there! (Pauses)                All right, next story..  Yeah, yeah, chew on that.  Oh, hey, listen, by the way - I'm hosting a little get-together                tonight in honor of my little financial upturn..  Elaine, you should be there to document it.  Yeah, but get there after nine. You know, give the poeple                a chance to loosen up.  (To George) Uh, No, no, no.. you go ahead. I gotta get                my thoughts together.  (Adding) Jerry, she's a loser. (George points to Kramer                - gesturing that he's right on target)  (Like a parent) Well, I still like the Bloomingdale's executive                training program for him.  Well, you know, I think it's something he should consider.  Listen, George, all these issues are interrelated.  All right, so what're you saying? That we're wrong? Oh,                everybody's wrong but you!  Which one?  Yeah, well, you got that straight! (Turns to Elaine) Hey,                Elaine, try the beef - because that's realy au jus sauce, huh. (Dramatically)                Real au jus sauce!  Yeah?  Ohh kay! Well, you know, I had Bob Saccamano on the phone,                and I suddenly realized that I- (Elaine stops him)  What do ya mean?  Yeah.  But I did sit in mud.  (Pleading) I was all dirty!  (To crowd) Hey, hey, hey! All right! Yeah, uh, yeah.. well..                Uh, the pants. they, uh, they fit, uh, well - and so I, uh, decided                I wasn't gonna return them!  What? You're gonna go now? Hey, woah! I don't.. (watches                his friends leave)  (Frantic) Kramer, Kramer! I got big trouble with the -                with the Van Buren Boys.  Hey, now, they're tough cookies.  Uh.. ah, (Looks over at Elaine, and realizes he can't tell                the Van Buren Boys story) Oh, nothing - nothing.. No, I certainly                don't have any stories, if that's  Yeah, well, uh.. you know uh, you didn't hear from me,                but, uh, the Van Buren Boys - they never hassle their own kind.  Oh, hey! Hey, have I told you about my bunions? Oh, you're                gonna love this story! (Rubs his hands together) So, I line up my                cold cuts on the couch  Damn!  Oh, I bought a bunch of bunion stories from Newman - but                they all stink!  Eight bucks! I think I got ripped off! (Leaves, yelling                out "Newman!")  Mister Peterson, you gotta sell me my stories back!  Yippie-yi-yay!  (enters apartment) Hey.  Hey, you got a hammer?  Well, I got this new poster. 3-D art? Computers generate 'em.  No, no, I don't have it now. I gotta pick it up at Mr. Pitt's.          Elaine was framing a bunch of stuff for him, so she did me a favor. What,          you wanna take a ride?  (shouting to the bathroom door) George, you wanna go for a ride?  Oh, COME ON!  All right, I've had it with you two. (opens apartment door to          leave)  A gymnast!  A gymnast, Jerry. Think of the flexibility. Mmm, that sex'll          melt your face.  (shuts door) "Bailing"?  Jerry, you should pay that price.  Ch- oo-... what?  (convulses in pain) Yeow! Whoa.  (exiting apartment) Yeah, yeah, yeah...  Elaine?  Yeah. (enters, points at package) Yah, huh?  (rips open package) Yeah, that's...  (holds up framed picture): There she blows! (throws paper around)  Oh, these are nice corners, huh?  (looking at picture) Yeah, it's 3-D art. Computers generate 'em.          BIG computers.  Well, you blur your eyes like you're starin' straight through          the picture. And you keep your eyes unfocused. And then... (Kramer and          Pitt stare at picture) Oh, oh, oh, YEAH!  Yeah, it's a spaceship, surrounded by planets, asteroids...  Ya' ever dream in 3-D? It's like the boogeyman is comin' right          at you.  (pointing) Right in here. Just keep your eyes unfocused. (convulses          in pain) Waahh! Oh, mama!  Mama!  I think I gotta go to the doctor! (exits) Oh, mama!  Hey.  I got a stone.  A kidney stone.  It's a, it's a stony mineral concretion, formed abnormally in          the kidney. And this jagged shard of calcium pushes its way through the          ureter into the bladder. It's forced out through the urine!  (enters apartment, holding up videotape) Behold! The Games of          the '84 Olympiad! Katya's silver medal performance! (inserts tape into          VCR, sets up TV)  Jerry, what is your problem?  All right, Jerry--are you familiar with the Kama Sutra?  Tantric yoga?  Jerry, you stand on the threshold to the magical world of sensual          delights that most men dare not dream of!  All right, all right, why don't we just watch the tape? (starts          playback)  Not yet. But the suspense is killing me.  Oh yeah. Oh yeah, that's her. (feminine grunts and sighs can          be heard as they watch the tape) Look at the height, Jerry, the extension!          Now watch the tuck. Handstand, half-turn, giant into a straddle, back          into another handstand. Nice kip. Reverse hecht. Oh, nice leg extension,          good form! Now, here comes the big dismount. Look at the rotation, full          in, double back, and she sticks the landing! (gets up to leave as George          and Jerry continue to watch, mouths agape) Perhaps you'd like to keep          the tape? (silence) Well, I'll take that as a yes.  You mean like the uneven parallel bars?  (Off-screen) No, I tried to do a reverse hecht off my couch and          I didn't make it.  (enters apartment, points at Jerry) Hey, what are you doing later?  Well, maybe you should try again. You know what happens the first          time: people are a little shy, a little reticent.  All right, where you going?  Well, Jerry, it's your obligation. C'mon.  No, no, no, I don't wanna go to the circus, Jerry.  Yeah, but I'm afraid of clowns!  Hey.  (Complaining) No more golf.  Well, you remember I told you about the pro, you know,                at the Westchester Country Club, who's letting me play a round every                time I give him a couple  (Angered) Yeah, well, I lost them all in the fire! (Leaning                over the couch, he addresses George) Hey, George, maybe you can                ask Susan's father for  Why? What's one thing got to do with another?  Well, I can't go back to the public courses, now. I can't!                I won't. I mean, you know what that's like? It's crowded, the grass                has big brown patches in it,  (Opening the door) Where? They're Cubans. (Leaves)  Oh, hey.  (Moving back into the room) Oh, yeah?  Uh, George, did you talk to that guy about getting me some                more cigars?  (Concluding) Okay.. well, I guess I'm just going to have                to take matters into my own hands, huh? (Pause) Alright, I'll see                you guys. (Leaves, despite  Buenos dias.  Uh, habla ingles?  Giddy-up. Ok, uh, (Looks at a woman wearing dark sunglasses                and sitting on a sofa behind him. He reacts oddly) Um. I need to                talk to someone.  Uh, well, It's a very private matter, but it's extremely                urgent.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  (Standing up, greeting the men) Buenos dias.  Uh, Kramer.  (Leaning in, confidentially) Cigars.  (Definite) Cigars.  Uh, see here, I.. (Pulls out a paper ring from his pocket)                I saved one of the cigar rings..  (Pointing at the cigar, incredibly nervous) Yeah, yeah.                That- that's, uh, okay, So, uh, I'd like to buy a couple of boxes                of those from you, yeah?  Um, wha - oh, illegal, huh?  Oh, hey!

(Trying to avoid the issue) Oh, yeah, yeah, Okay, we're                going. (To his three friends) Vamanos, muchachos!  Hey.  Boy, I have really had it with Newman. He wakes me up again                last  I said " Jump." Well, he's been threatening to                do this for years. I  No job. No women.  What am I supposed to tell him? How much there is for him                to live  Why don't you use the machines down in the basement?  How 'bout if I put a few things --  Well, you're going over there.  Have you ever met my guys?  Well!  Ah!  Yeah.  He jumped.  Yeah. Newman jumped.   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  I said " Wave to me when you pass my window."  No! He jumped from the second floor. Mr. Papanickolous                saw him from  What's the matter?  Where? Where?  Okay. Come on. Give the guy his money. What -- what are                you doing?

I didn't realize it was a full box.  It was in my laundry.   It was about 1200 bucks.  Oh! That's Newman.  Well, what are you waiting for?  You wanna shoot some pool tonight?  Hi guys.  Hello Archie, Veronica, Mr. Weatherbee. . . . Is this Don Matingly's          signature?   And Buck Showalter's?  Um, can I show this to my buddy Stubbs . He runs a sports memorabilia          store. He pays top dollar for pro autographs.   No, of course not. (winks back)  You know, you see Don Matingly signed this envelope then he sent          it to room 318, where it was received and signed for by manager Buck Showalter.  Why?  Ah, Mr. Weatherbee.   Sure do.  Here you go.  You'll be pleased to see what's inside.  You're cut of the loot. Stubs gave me 200 dollars for the autographed          birthday card that was inside.  You did.  No, not in so many words but I believe we had an understanding.          (winks)  Well Stubs has already sold it to some guy who's kid's in the          hospital .  Look, do you want me to get it back or not?  That you Bobby?  Oh, that's it, yeah. Boy, Stubs sure went to town with this thing          huh? Yeah, well, Bobby, uh, what if I told you a very important person          at the New York Yankees needed this card back.   Well, uh, Bobby, uh, who's your favorite Yankee.  All right. What if I tell Paul O'Neill to hit a home run tomorrow,          just for you.  For you he would.  Two? Sure kid, yeah. But then you gotta promise you'll do something          for me.  Yeah, that would be nice. But I really just need this card.  Mr. O'Neill?  Yeah, uh, look, you don't know me.  No, it's uh, not that see,. It's about a little boy in a hospital.          I was wondering if you could do something to lift his spirits.   Sure, well I promised you would hit him two home runs.  You know, Klick!. A couple of dingers.  Yeah, well, no good?  Two is better than one.  Well, Babe Ruth did it.  Oh, do you say that Babe Ruth is a liar?   Well, maybe I did overextend myself.  It's hot in here. Hey, Bobby, can I have some of your juice?  Yeah.  OH YEAH! ALL RIGHT!  You know Bobby, it's very very hard to hit two home runs in one          game. Even for Paul O'Neill.  He can do it, Mr. Kramer. I know he can. He'll do it for me.  Come on Come on!  GO! GO!!  An In The Park Home Run!  All Right! Yeah, well, I guess I'll be on my way (grabs framed          card)  Huh?   Yeah, maybe not technically, but   Oh, come on. Bobby, Bobby! That's just as good!  Now, Bobby, Bobby, we had a deal . . . gimme that    Hi,   (to George) Oh, by the way, tomorrow night, Paull O'Neill has          to catch a fly ball in his hat.  And you were probably just going to stick it in an envelope.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, hey.  Haircut.  Oh course. I wouldn't let that other butcher cut my hair.  The uncle Enzo. That's the guy Jerry uses.  You can get a good one today. It's Enzo's day off. Gino's                there all by himself.  What bachelor auction?  And you didn't ask me to do it? I could raise enough money                to cure polio.  Polio?  What are you all dressed up for?  Yeah. How'd it go?  No way my Gino did that. It's an Enzo.  So what?  His feelings? You can't continue seeing him. You're destroying                yourself. I'm not going to let   I'm going to call Gino, you're going to see him, and we're                going to get that haircut fixed up.  All right, geez. You're crazy.  It the worst haircut Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.  I'd like to have shoehorn hands.  Okay listen to me. I talked to Gino, he's going to fix                the haircut.  No buts. His apartment tonight, Eight o'clock.  I don't know.  Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive. I told you he could do it.  Yeah, so?  No. He doesn't know.  Listen you're just imagining things. He doesn't know a                thing. Now come on. Pull yourself   What are you kidding? Look at him. He's grotesque.  Do I think? He's repugnant.  Whatever it takes.  Equivalent.  Elaine, all right, who looks better in this shirt? Me or                Mickey?  Tell me about it. We just picked up two women at the Gap.  Well, you too seem to have the same taste.  Well I have the same shirt.  Oh. (Waiter approaches table)  I live for Merlot.  I don't believe that.  Why were you holding the door open for?  Well, I thought it was a nice gesture. But I guess I was                wrong!  I don't even know their names! Look, why don't you just                take the one that was on the left?  Oh, everybody's your type.  You've been married three times.  Come on, let him go. You want throw? Let's throw!  All right, so we let the girls decide.  Yeah, I wanna wear that shirt next time.  That's right, 'cause they already saw it.  What are they doing here?  All right, all right. Now what're we gonna do?  All right, I'll take Julie.  All right, I'll take Karen.  All right, which one is Julie? (They walk over to the table                and fight over who sits where) Hey, you ladies look lovely tonight.                (Continue to struggle)  Well, I gotta do somethin'.  (Confused) No, Mickey and I, we can't work it out. You                know, I'm thinking of asking that Karen out by myself.  I was, but the one I thought was Julie turned out to be                Karen.  Hi.  Got a minute?  Sure.  Hi.  So, I'll uh... all right. (Hangs up)  No, Julie. She's the one.  Well, Mickey and her have a lot more in common. you know                her parents are little people?  Oh yeah, and vice versa. Mother Nature's a mad scientist,                Jerry.  Those people, listen to yourself.  You think that dentists are so different from me and you?                They came to this country just like everybody else, in search of                a dream.  Yeah, and you're an anti-dentite.  You're a rabid anti-dentite! Oh, it starts with a few jokes                and some slurs. "Hey, denty!" Next thing you know you're                saying they should have their own schools.  Yeah!  I just assume not sit next to you.  (To Mr. Abbott) How ya doing?  Alright. I'm ready. (To George) You know, I still don't                understand - why do you want to move back in with your parents?  Well, move in here.  Why doesn't he just move in here?  You can move in with me, if you want.  Hello, Mrs. Costanza.  Well, I gotta bring in more stuff. (Heads for the door)  Yeah. (Exits)  Uhh.. no thanks. (Goes back out the door)  (Enters with a box) Alright, that's it. Anything else?  Oh, I gotta go move the car. (Leaves)  Yeah, well, that was a good one.  You know that, uh, Leslie (Points to her) is in the clothing                business? She's a designer.  In fact, she's come up with a new one that is going to                be the big new look in mens fashions.. It's a, a puffy shirt. (Leslie                mumbles to Kramer) Well, yeah,  Yeah, see, I think people want to look like pirates. You                know, it's the right time for it.. to be all puffy, and devil-may-care..  (Still laughing) That's true.. (Gets up) I'll be right                back. (Walks off laughing. Jerry and Elaine are left with the low-talker.                A moment passes)  Hey. (He's carrying a suit cover. He hangs it on Jerry's                coat hooks)  Hey, George! (Holds out his hand. George shakes it - a                hand buzzer goes off. George starts freaking out. Kramer laughs)  What?!  (Laughing) But, it's only a toy!  A hand model?  (To George) Really? Let me look at them..  Let's see.. oh, those are nice. You know, I've never noticed                this before? They're smooth.. creamy.. delicate, yet (Turns to Jerry)                masculine.  Yeah..  You're not going to believe what happening with Leslie.                You know, ever since you agreed to wear the puffy shirt on the Today                show, she's been getting  Agreed to wear the puffy shirt. (Starts unzipping the suit                cover)  When you said that you'd agree to wear the puffy shirt                on the Today show. (Takes the ridiculous puffy shirt out of the                cover)  Yes!  Yeah, yeah.  When we went to dinner the other night.  What were you talking about when I went to the bathroom?  There you go.  Yes, yes! You said it!  (Takes it off the hook, and starts walking toward Jerry                with it. He backs defensively backs away from it) Well, she asked                you.  Well, you gotta wear it now! All those stores are stocking                it based on the condition that you're gonna wear this on the TV                show! The factory in New  Yes, yes. This pirate trend that she's come up with, Jerry,                - this is gonna be the new look for the 90's. You're gonna be the                first pirate!  Yeah, come in.  Giddy-Up. (Stagehand leaves) Jerry! Five minutes!  Now that's a great looking shirt! (Gets up, admiring the                shirt) Ayye Captain! (Growls like a pirate) Yeah! I'm glad I ironed                it. It's perfect. (Walks around  (Reassuring) Hey, this look's better than anything you                own. You know, in two months time, everybody's gonna be wearing                the (imitates a pirate) pirate  Yeah.  Great.  It's the puffy shirt. Look at it, eh? Whatd'ya think? Is                it cool or what?  (To Elaine, muffled, low, and threatening) Elaine, you                want to stop?  Why can't            I play Kramer?  Neither            are you.  Oh come            on Jerry. How hard is it to act. You say something, I'll pretend it's            funny.  Ha ha            ha. Your grandmother's in the hospital!  What you            didn't think I was really laughing?  Let me            see you do it.  Alright.            I've never been to Mars but I imagine it's quite lovely.  Mine was            better than that! Come on look. (starts to laugh again, Jerry too)  (to Jerry)            Well at least let me audition.  (to George)            Yeah!  Oughh!  (to the            phone) Hold on a second I got another call. Hello? Yeah, he'll call            you back. (Jerry and George look at each other)  That's            NBC.  I'm in            the middle of a conversation here.  (to the            phone) Look, I'll call you back. (hangs up)  Russell            Dalrimple's secretary.  That's            true.  (acting            very bad) I saw Joe DiMaggio in Dinky Doughnuts again, but this time,            I went in. (pause, stops acting) Oh! Uh, where's the bathroom?  Yeah.            Be right back. (Kramer leaves)  I got            mugged.  Well,            I wouldn't have minded it so much but I was running home to go to the            bathroom.  It was            full. I tried a few other places, you know, but that didn't work. I            mean it was an emergency Jerrry. I was really percolating... So I decided            to run home through the park and then these two guys they stopped me            and...   But now            I have a big problem, buddy.  Well,            I waited so long I-- I missed my chance.  No. And            now I can't get it back.  How could            you not think about it?  (mumbles            and leaves)  I like            to eat spaghetti with just a fork. Because I can keep the strands long,            and I can slurp it out to my mouth. Like this look. (faking to slurp            spaghetti) Now sex, I like the bottom. Let them do all the work. You            should be writing this stuff down... (waitress comes to take the order)            Bran lakes...100%. I got a big problem.  Yeah,            that's good. Oh, now I like to play golf.  You gotta            play him like me. I'm Karmer.  Whoa,            I'm Kramer.  So what's up, Diggity Dog?  Oh, that's too bad. Now don't say I didn't try to warn                you.  Oh, Jerry, I'm *surprised* at you!  It's a *con*. These agencies are usually a front for some                money  The alternative media, Jerry. That's where you hear the                truth.  I'm in here. C'mon...  Well--  Well, Newman and I are going partners selling used records.  Yeah, so we thought if you had any of those big, y'know,                old-  Y'know, we'd take them off your hands, free of charge.  Five bucks???  [In Newman's ear] He's gyppin' us...  Wait, wait, wait... Sergio Mendes has a cult following.  He can't even walk down the street in South America...  [In Newman's ear] I don't like it...  [In Newman's ear] Alright, well be back, jack.  Well, here's your *albums* [Journey "Escape"                is on top, BTW...]  Hey, what kind of stuff are you listening to?

No, y'know we took the old man's records over to Ron's                and he  Yeah, a real brouhaha...  Michael Richards  It's the perfect cover for a money laundering operation                . No one can keep track of all those kids  Oh! Yeah your old college roommate huh?  Hmmm,, Dramatica comedia heh!  Euh.. We don't go to enough theater.  Why don't you just give up?  At least that's what Jerry says. Now face it. If it hasn't                happen it's not gonna happen.  I think she was happy someone finally said it.  'felt that the conversation was lagging.  I come in here to get a pleasant meal and if we're not                gonna have one I'll grab a bite to eat at your  hey! you got some messages.. Yeahumm.. .George, George,                Elaine, George again, Elaine, Newman; but that was a crank call.  Well that's not how she remembers it.  Aahh...Who's Janet?  And you must....look exactly like Jerry. You don't see                this; you're like twins .. WOoooohhhhh!!!  C'mon George relax . Just because they look alike doesn't                mean you're secretly in love with Jerry.  yeah, she's a nice girl, kinda quiet though.  Well how should I have "broached the subject"  Well sounds like someone's having a bad day.  Well, I think one of us should leave.  I've made an important life decision.  Aw right. I know I've been shooting off at the mouth lately;                First with that girl whose life  I know you want me to keep my big mouth shut and that's                exactly what I'm going to do.  What do I need to talk for.. ha! , For to blab to the neighbors                about George has a new fem-Jerry  Jerry, ninety four percent of communications is non-verbal.                Here watch.  Well it's Frank and Estelle's reaction of hearing George's                man love towards she-Jerry.  That's the idea.  (makes a zipper gesture to his mouth) ..Weeeeeepp!!  (loudly) Now you gotta shut up!.....(Sally is speechless)...I'm                sorry, I..I haven't spoken in days.  ...All right ..Starting now......  No, pool. I just swam 200 laps.   Look at hose babies [hands]. They're prunes. I saw Conrad going          up to oyur place.  Who, Damien? Nothing, just a mischievous, rambunctious kid.  got problems Jerry.  Well I had been swimming for three hours and I was in a real          grove so I decided to keep going. But at ten they start the aquasonics          Thirty-five geriatrics throwing elbows. It was like I was swimming through          a flabby armed spanking machine.  A half hour then diving class started. Well that got a          little messy. I gotta find a new place to swim 'cause that pooll can't          hold me, Jerry.  What's that guy's last name again?  Oh, that's right.  Oh, no no no no I'll take it. Why don't you come over. Let's          see if it will fit in my bedroom.  My old one sprung a leak.  Sand! It's like sleeping on the beach.  Jer.  Well my swimming pool problems are solved. I just found myself          miles and miles of open lanes.  That's East River.  Technically Norfolk  has more gross tonnage.  I saw a couple of other guys out there.  Floating, they weren't moving much. But they were out there.  Oh man, I'm on the wrong floor again.  Hey, you know what I think it is? I think it's that East River.          I think it might be polluted.  It is very obtrusive.  You can't get a stool in here.  No, that's no good. I'm leaving.  Oh, hey,   Hal, .. uh Langerhans.  Oh, Kitzmiller. That's right  Oh, I'm jiff.  Oh, listen I gotta get to the pier. The ferry traffic is really          bad around four thirty. Look, I still got the key to your apartment and          I'll get it back to you as soon as I can.  Yeah, sure, um, oh boy, . . .   That's it.  Oh, we go back a ways.  That's right.   No, no. She put a stop to that.   Oh yeah. Exercises every muscle in the body. It's great for the          back.  Four hours in this chop and I'm a full inch taller. . . . Giddyup.          What's going on?  He just sunk like a stone.  Hey, watch where you're kicking!  Elaine  Yeah.  Come on up.  Taste this.  No, taste it. Taste it.  You've never had cantaloupe like this before.  Jerry. This is great cantaloupe.  Ah, huh. It's good?  Good, huh?  I got it at Joe's.  Forty-nine cents a pound. That's practically half than                what you're paying at the supermarket. I don't know why you don't                go to Joe's.  It's three blocks further. You can use my shopping cart..  See, the other thing is, if you don't like anything, he                takes it right back.  I liked Marlene. What's her number?  George, I want you to taste this cantaloupe.  It's the best cantaloupe I ever had.  Jerry, tell him how good this cantaloupe is.  Hey.  I got it! This time, I got it!  Hips! See, it's all hips.  You gotta come through with the hips first. (Demonstrates)  Joe's?  Well, is it good?  Let me taste it. (Takes a bite, spits it out) See, that                stinks. You can't eat that. You should take it back.  Alright, I'll take it back. I'm going by there.  Jerry, you should care. Cantaloupe like this should be                taken out of circulation.  Well?  (Smiles) Oh. Oh, Marlene.  I thought you were trying to get rid of her?  Does George know?  Yeah, no kidding.  Woah, psycho-sexual.  Man, I don't understand people. I mean, why would George                want to deprive you of pleasure? Is it just me?  You're his friend. Better that she should sleep with someone                else. Some jerk that he doesn't even know.  You're a human being.  You're flesh and blood.  Nope. No good.  Well, I'm taking this back. (Leaves)  Sniffing, what do you mean sniffing?   Jerry, he probably had a cold.   So, what are you saying?   Drugs? You think he's on drugs?   Jerry, listen, we went in on a CD together.   And Newman gave you money too. I didn't even meet this                guy. We trusted you.   Well, what else? Was he nervous? Did he use a lot of slang?                Did he use the word 'man'?   I mean when he was leaving did he say I'm splittin' ?   Whoh!   Yes!! Yes, that's what they do! They live in the bathroom!                All right, what are we going to do? We are going to get our money                back, right?   Yeah.   Anything new on that guy on drugs?   Then why the sniffing? Who walks around *sniff, sniff*                sniffing?   South America?   Yyyeeaaah!!   Well, I say we're going to take our money right now!   Yeah, he skipped out and *ptruut* went to South America!                Wait, there is one way to find out. We set up a sting.                You know like Abscam. Like Abscam Jerry.   What's today?   Really? Feels like Tuesday.   I feel Tuesday and Wednesday...   Yeah, maybe we oughta become private detectives...   Maybe I will.   Just gonna find out if he's interested.   All right, I'm going in.   I'll have a brewsky , Charlie.   Oh, there's nothing like a cold one after a long day, eh?                Oh yeah, I've been known to drink a beer or two. But then                again, I've been known to do a lot of things.   Cigarette?   I suck'em down like Coca-Cola. Well here's to feeling good                all the time.   Looks like you've got yourself a little cold there, eh?                Me neither.   South America?   That's importuning(?) continent.   Tell me about it.   I'm hip.   To the whole scene. *sniff*   The bathroom scene. *sniff, sniff*   Exclamation point.   Elaine, he was sniffing like crazy around me.   Double exclamation point!   Hey, Ralph.   Mushrooms, you got mushrooms Jerry?   What's the matter? You've got a cold?   It's a sweater.   I don't know, Jerry gave it to me.   Jerry, I was wearing it in the bar.   Not to mention the picture of him on the toilet.   All right, What about the money?   Morty, are you coming in?  (To Jerry) Hey, how'd you do?  Yeah!  I'm completely changing the configuration of the apartment.                You're not gonna believe it when you see it. A whole new lifestyle.  Levels.  Yeah, I'm getting rid of all my furniture. All of it. And                I'm going to build these different levels, with steps, and it'll                all be carpeted with a lot of pillows. You  No, no. It's all in my head.  Oh, I'll be comfortable.  Ohh.. should be done by the end of the month.  It's a simple job. Why, you don't think I can?  Well, I got the tools. I got the pillows. All I need is                the lumber.  Well, this time, this time you're wrong. C'mon. I'll even                bet you.  A big dinner with dessert. But I've got till the end of                the month.  No, no, no. End of the month.  Oh, hi. I just came to say goodbye. (Gestures to the bags)                ..Need any help with those?  Oh, well.. I decided I'm not gonna do it.  Yeah. So long, Morty. (Morty leaves)  There's no dinner. The bet's off. I'm not gonna do it.  There's not bet if I' not doing it.  Yeah, well, I could do it. I don't want to do it.  And it could be done.  But I don't want the levels!  he asked me  Hey.  So you ready?  Oh, yeah. What? You got no luggage?  Okay.  I don't know.  Oh, no way.  How much? $ 100? $200? $ 1000?  Come on, Jerry, it's a lock.  But it's a lock, Jerry!  You sure?  This is your swanky Diplomat's Club.  What's this, a fellow club member?  Yeah. I'm gonna get some snacks before my flight.  Hey, how you doin'?  Name's Kramer.  Oh I'm happy right here. Isn't this place amazing? Planes                flying in from all corners of the world, and they know the minute                they're arriving.  Bet? Um, not betting.  I haven't made a bet in three years, I-  Okay, how much?  You're on, cowboy!  C'mon Seattle, let's go.  Seattle, yeah!  All right, c'mon, let's go again.  All right, look, one more bet. Double or nothing. C'mon.  All right, let me call my bank. You stay here. (He calls)  Yeah, it's, uh, me.  All right, listen. I need some cash.  I just need it, that's all.  I'm at the airport.  We've been betting on arrivals and departures. (Newman                rolls eyes) But I'm down $3200 , so you've gotta get me some cash.  Sure you do.  Oh help me man, I'm desperate!  Hey.  Good. (To Earl) Here's my collateral.  Yeah, don't I know it.  All right, how 'bout Ithaca vs. Boston?  Double or nothin'.  Yeah, he was.  Oh I accept.  Yeah, it's a pleasure doin' business with a gentleman like                yourself. (Elaine enters)  Oh hi Elaine. What are you doing here?  Boy...  C'mon!  What?  Oh hey, Helen uh, Could I uh, use some more of your hand lotion?  (putting on the lotion) Ya  Mmm (smelling the lotion as he rubs it in) I'm gonna remember          that if I'm ever in Florida.  Ya  Well uh that doesn't surprise me, ya i bought these at Rudy's.          It's a used clothing store. See when people like you die, the widows they          bring in their wardrobes, they make a bundle.  Ya if they're vintage, and you're a widow.  Well I suppose the children do.  (takes another smell of his hands) Alright I gotta a ten o'clock,          I'll see everybody later.  You must be Aaron, I've heard about you.  Yeah.  So uh what are you guys doing for dinner?  Now what is Executive?  Yea these are a hot item over at Rudy's.  Get 'em up here. You give me twenty-five percent I-I'll take          care of everything.  Yaaaa.  So how'd you come up with the idea for the belt-less trench coat?  How serendipitous.  Mmm  Did you call Jack Klompus yet?  Mousse. I moussed up.  You know, I should've done this years ago. I mean, I feel                like I had two lives. My pre-mousse and now, I begin my post-mousse.                Hey, tell me the truth,  Oh, I keep forgetting to enter that.  (Talking about his hair) Hey, Harold, what do you think?  (Not knowing what Manny said) Thanks.  You know, I don't even know why you're fooling around with                this ring. I've been telling you, get yourself some plugs, or a                piece.  Oh, man. You know, you're crazy. You're a good looking                guy. What do you want to walk around like that for?  Hey, my new neighbor!  What?  So, okay. What's the problem?  C'mon, you can come up with five thousand dollars.. Jerry,                you don't have five thousand dollars you can led her? Come on.  Loan her the money. You can afford it.  Oh, c'mon. She'll pay you back. What's five grand between                friends?  Yeah, so what's the problem?  He said he'd loan you the money.  That's okay. He doesn't care.  Get outta here.  What's to think about?  You didn't want her in the building?  Well, then what did you loan her the five thousand for?                Oh, look, maybe she won't take it.. I mean, she did say that she                was going to think about it.  I still don't understand what the problem is having her                in the building.  Because I'm a pod?  Well, it's all taken care of. Everything's cool.  Elaine.  I just found a guy who's willing to pay ten thousand dollars                for the apartment.  (Nods) Cash.  He's in the music business.  Well, occasionally, I like to help the humans.  (Talking about the music) Oh, I love the one they do right                after this one!  Hey.  Well I got it!  What do you think?  My buddy works in an appliance store and he got us thirty percent off.  Good one? It's the Commando 8.  12.000 BTU's.  Yeah, but Amy likes air conditioning.  Okay, so, I'm gonna measure the window up, okay buddy?  Yeah.  Yeah, rock on!  You know you ought to do? Go see my friend Dwayne at J & T Optical                  and Columbus Avenue. He'll give you thirty percent off.  Retail is for suckers.  You just gotta mention my name.  That's it.  The AC is on his way.  What?  Well did you mention my name?  And?  Now I don't believe this. That guy owes me big time. I got him off                  sugar! Look, I'm gonna go down there with you right now.  Little Snowball? He runs on batteries!  Look, all you gotta to is get Amy and Jeffrey together somewhere, that's                  it.   Right this way, mister Doody!  Hey, Dwayny.  What is going on here?  I'm talking about the thirty percent discount.  Ooh, how quickly we forget. You owe me buddy.  Remember this?  Six months ago you were eating four of those for breakfast and chasing                  it with a ring ding. And two butter fingers on the train. Sounds familiar?  Remember that night I found you at Dinky Donuts? You were all hopped                  up on cinnamon swirls! They wouldn't serve you anymore! You wouldn't even have                  any teeth if it wasn't for me taking you over to Joe's fruit stand and stuff                  a cantaloupe down your throat! So much for gratitude... yeah, yeah, yeah!  We'll see you Dwayne.  Commando 8 has arrived!  12.000 BTU's of raw cooling power.  Installed!  No, just plug it in and the Commando 8 does the rest. (And to Jerry:)                  I'll seal that up later, right?  Of what?  Oh that's fatal, you don't want that!  No, no, it's all right. I had a friend who had rabies once.   May I have one of those, madam?  They're ladies' glasses.  Now look here, see it's right here: Gloria Vanderbilt Collection.  She's got rabies, just like my friend Bob Sacamano. She's delirious.  She's foaming at the mouth!  (Singing:) Oh myyyy papayaaaa.   The air conditioner!  I think it got the dog!  Got any shredded coconut?  Yeah, yeah, right. (walks out)  Yeah, this is better. So, you got any shredded coconut?  D-d-d-d. I gotta switch shaving cream. I'm getting no protection.  Whatever you get.  Don't tell me she's dragging another poor guy across Europe.  She's dating him again, huh?  Boy, a month in Europe with Elaine. That guy's coming home                in a body  Hey, what are you doing?  Did you see Bania's set last night? 'Cause I read on the                Internet he  Well, you gotta give him some credit. (starts rubbing a                stick of  What?  I ran out of butter so I had to borrow yours. Anything                else, Mr. Nosy?  I'm shaving with it.  Jerry, it's vastly superior to any commercial shaving cream.                Now feel  Feel it.  Feel it. Feel it.  They hooked me up.  I'm shaving with it, and you know what I discovered?  No, my face feels so good, I'm gonna use it all over my                body.  Oh, man. I think I cooked myself.  Stick a fork in me, Jerry. I'm done.  I'm fried.  Well, I just gotta keep my skin moist so I don't dry out.  No, I read an article in Bon Appetite magazine.  Just a few more squirts. Cause I gotta stay juicy.  Yeah, it's baked on it. Put some butter in. Stir it up                so it melts.  Ahh, now I'm simmering.  What are you doing? George tells me you're gonna throw                your set?  Oh, tough crowd.  You didn't do so bad.  No, you had some good stuff. The cancer bit? It was edgy,                it was not  Like that guy who yelled out.  And laughter is the best medicine.  Hey, Jerry, he could have used your laugh. He was a big                turkey out  A big fat turkey.  He worked so hard and then he just--  What is this, oregano?  Look at me! I'm all covered in oregano and Parmesan, and                it's sticking  What is this, parsley?  Get off of me, get off of me!  Oh, they've got a cure for cancer. See, it's                all big business.. Oh hey, Jerry just walked in. Hi, George. (resumes                talking on the phone) Yeah, yeah yeah,  Take it.  It's for you.  Well, it's your phone. He wanted to talk to                you  Well, why not?  That's for me. (into phone) Kramerica Industries..                Oh, hi, Mark.. No, no, no. Forget that. I got a better idea. A pizza                place where you make your own  (ignoring Jerry) No, no, no. I'm talking about                a whole chain of 'em. Yeah. (Kramer leaves Jerry's apartment while                still on the phone.)  Oh, hey guys. Man, I'm telling you. This pizza                idea, is really going to happen.  Yeah, we give you the dough, you smash it,                you pound it, you fling it in the air; and then you get to put your                sauce and you get to sprinkle your cheese,  It's all supervised.  All of it. You want to invest?  No, I'm tellin' ya, people, they really want                to make their own pizza pie.  That's you.  Okay, okay. I just wanted to check with you                guys.  You know, this business is going to be big.                I just wanted .. okay. (he exits quickly, then sticks his head back                through the door) One day, you'll beg me to  Oh, hi Elaine, hey. (to Jerry) Hey, you missed                a great game tonight, buddy!  Knock game. Horneck took me. We were sitting                two rows behind the bench. We were getting hit by sweat!  Last week. When I, you know, game you the                phone. He's really into my pizza place idea!  You make your own pie!  Yeah.  Okay, who wants meatloaf?  (to Joel) It's gonna be hot in a minute. (exits)  Hello!  (doing                the voice) La la la.  Look at                this, they are redoing the Cloud Club.  Of course                its a good idea, its   You see                I come up with these things, I know theyre gold, but nothing                happens. You know why?  (interrupts)                No, notime! Its all this meaningless time. Laundry,                grocery, shopping, coming in here talking to you. Do you have any                idea how much time I waste in this apartment?  Here we                go; now she comes in. Now my whole day is shot!  Hoochie                moochie. (haha)  (still                reading the paper) Man, 2.9 percent financing on a Toyota Onedun                (Sp?). That was my idea too!  So                thats the bedroom. Heres the bathroom. If you need to,                you can familiarize yourself with the kitchenYeah, go ahead                and look through some of the drawers.   Yeah,                thats Jerry, you dont have to worry about him. Why dont                you go across the hall and get started on that mail.  Hes                a go getter!  My intern                from NYU. Well, you remember my corporation, Kramerica Industries.  Well,                apparently NYU is very enthusiastic about their students getting                some real world corporate experience.   Well,                this will really free up my time so I can focus on more important                things, like my bladder system.  Jerry,                its not for people, its for oil tankers.  You see                the idea is for a rubber ball inside the tanker so if it crashes,                the oil wont spill out.  (smiles)                yeah.  Yeah,                5.  What?                When did this happen?  (yelling)                DARREN!  Sorry                I couldnt get out of there, what did I miss? (asking his "intern")  Uh huh  Boysenberry,                the kid is still learning.  Yeah,                well nothing before noon.  Yeah,                your phone is line one.  Dean Jones,                you wanting to talk to me?  Yeah.  I know                it sounds pretty glamorous, but its business as usual at Kramerica.                  And with                Darrens help, well get that chicken.  Well,                I have to say this seems capricious and arbitrary.  I dont                know. I found them in your closet. Ever since Darren left I havent                been able to find anything. He took all my clothes to some cleaners.                Im clueless. (looks at clock) Is that clock right?  I was                supposed to pick up Newman at the zoo twelve hours ago.  Jerry,                buddy, I got to tell you something. That voice is played.  So played.  Darren?                What are you doing here? The college canceled the internship.  Kramerica                is no more.  Probably.                Darren, you go home. Forget about Kramerica.  Well,                youre still here?  Well,                I havent changed my mind.  Well,                you are a tenacious little monkey. Alright, Ill do it. Kramerica                industries lives! Lets get back to work!  Lets                see what Jerry has to eat.  Hey.  Its                a tank of oil. Darren and I are finally going to test out my bladder                system.  No. No.                No. Its for oil tankers. All I need to do is fill some sort                of rubber container with oil and then drop it to see whether or                not it can restrain the impact.  Conceivably.  Did you                bring the video camera?  You gave                up the voice?  Whew.                You know Darren, if you would have told me twenty-five years ago                that some day Id be standing here about to solve the worlds                energy problems, I wouldve said youre crazy Now                lets push this giant ball of oil out the window.  Bombs                away (Uh oh).  Well,                that didnt work. Hey, how about thisketchup and mustard                in the same bottle?   Yeah.  Darren                is going away for a long long time.   (doing                the voice) La la la.  Hey! JoJo!  No, thank you. So what are you doing?  Come on, let's go to the beach.  What? It's a beautiful day.  Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the         air.  Yeah, there's something in the air.  Oh hey!  Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas  You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.  You're moving to California?  Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for         years! You might never come  Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a         virgin, she's a whore.  Fling!  I say Japan.  Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're         quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine         art of fishing - or baking.  Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?  Oh yeah - oui oui.  The only way to fly.  Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.  I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.  I lost my balance.  It was an accident.  I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!  We're straightening out!  I want to capture this.  All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.  What?  The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.  Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?  I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.  This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we         gotta make it last.  I bet.  How bout me, Jackie?  Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.  Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about         when he asked that cop   I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.  Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do         Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye         Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.  I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.  Listen, I'm gonna get a hot dog at Payapa King.  I'm starvin', I haven't had any dinner!  I don't wanna get a movie hot dog!  Well, just save me a seat.  Good question.  He's spaced out.  [thinks for a while]  Could you do me a favor? If you see a guy that's five foot                eleven,   Hey, did that guy show up?  No, the guy with the big head and the flared nostrils.  Uh, no, see, my friend already bought me a ticket.  Is that seat taken?  It was on the seat...  Yeah, right...  It's yellow mustard. [To George] Can you break a twenty?  Jerry, look at all these pagodas, huh? I gotta get over                to Hong Kong before it all goes back to China..  Oh, boy, look at this. Hong Kong's outlawed the rickshaw.                See, I always thought those would be perfect for New York.  Hmm, Elaine's been to Hong Kong. I should give her a call.  (Remembering) No, that wasn't dancing.  Oh? Who's Leo?  Oh, yeah. Right. Uncle, Leo. Forgot his first name..  (To Jerry) Well, that ougta keep you busy for a few days,                huh?  (Taking his offer seriously) No, we've already eaten.  Jerry, check this out. (Pointing at some papers on the                table) Remember my idea about rickshaws in New Youk? Well, we're                gonna make it happen!  Newman, he knows a guy in the Hong Kong post office..  We'll start out with one, and they when it catches on,                we're gonna have a whole fleet!  (To Newman) Well, I just assumed you would.  (Stopping his thought) Da-da-da-da no.  (Brainstorming) What about the homeless?  (Explaining) To pull the rickshaw.  They're always walkin' around the city. Why not just strap                something to them?!  Alright, listen up. Now, you three have been hand-picked                out of possibly dozens that applied. Now, what we're looking for                are motivated,  (Continuing as if nothing happened) Because to pull rickshaws                means more than just strong legs. You're also going to need a well-toned                upper body.  (To Rusty) You know, I once knew a horse named Rusty. No                offence.  (Watching Rusty's pulling of the rickshaw) Giddy up! Good                form.  Hey, what's he doin'?  Well, then, he's out!  (While washing his hands in Jerry's kithen sink) Well,                the rickshaw's gone. We strapped it to a homeless guy and he (Makes                a noise), he bolted.  (To Newman) See, we should've gotten some collateral from                him.. Like his bag of cans, or.. his other bag of cans.  Hey, buddy.  I thought I heard you.  Our rickshaw?  (Exiting the bedroom with Newman) Let's talk in Jerry's                kitchen. I'll make some cocoa.  Rusty!  (Sarcastic) Yeah, yeah. We'll get back to you. (Pulling                the rickshaw with Newman) Let's get this baby home.  What?  Yes, that's true.  Well, there's only one way to settle this. (Starts pointing                back and forth between Newman and him with each word of the rhyme)                One spot, two spot,  Best two out of three? (Starts the pointing and the rhyme                again) One spot, two spot..  (Tired) Oh, I can't go on. I gotta take a break. (Sets                the rickshaw down - taking a rest)  (Stretching) Oh..  Woah! Wait!  Hey!  It's a method, Jerry. It's intense. (Clicks his tongue)  Yeah, and I'm playing a business man accused of murder.  (Fixing up his pants) Yeah.. look at this, Mickey. These                pants are fallin' apart, huh?  (Looking over Mickey's shoulder at the script) Yeah, well,                I was a different man then.  (Slightly offended) Hey, I got the body of a.. taught,                pre-teen, Swedish boy.  Now, what are you thinkin'? (Getting upset) You think that                I'm not able to wear jeans anymore? Is that what you're sayin'?                Because if that's what you're  Uh, yeah, I bought Dungarees.  Well, they're slim-fit.  (Talking fast) Yeah, they're streamlined.  (Making his way toward the door) What? They just gotta                be worked in a little bit, that's all. (Pulling the door shut behind                him) Alright, see you later.  Jerry, you gotta help me!  I can't get my pants off, and Mickey's audition is in twenty                minutes! You know, I'm supposed to be a business man, I gotta be                in costume!  (Bracing himself on a bar stool) Yeah, I already did it.                It won't come off. The zipper's suck..  She was probably joking.  She didn't have any?  She faked 'em all.  Well so she faked 'em, so what?  You know I heard her screaming from my apartment? She woke me up a few times.  Yeah I could have helped you out.  I could have given you some pointers. I know how to press those buttons body.  Aaaaah.  Giddy-up.  You know, I faked it.  Yeah.  Well you know, if it's enough already and I just wanna get some sleep.  It's terrible!   Yeah, of course I got it at Joe's.  You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna return this.  Jerry this peach is sub par.  I want restitution.  Because it's no good.  It's still your fruit, you gotta stand behind your fruit.  So...  You know this whole place is going vrrrrrrrrrrrrt, downhill. I could have come in here last week with a bad plum but I let it go.  Oh now you don't want my business.  But what am I gonna do for fruit?  Hey listen, if I give you money would you go out and get me some fruit?  Well I got banned from the store I can't go back in there now.  Well you know, we had a fight over the peach and... well Joe doesn't want my business.  Jerry, what am I gonna do for fruit?  The supermarket? That's impossible! They don't have a decent piece of fruit at the supermarket. The apples are mealy, the oranges are dry. I don't know what's going on with the Papayas! Jerry you gotta go to Joe's, you gotta get me some fruit!   Okay, I'm gonna make you a fruit list, all right?  All right now here's the list.  I like mangos.  Well they gotta be soft.  Not too soft. Better too hard than too soft.  Yeah now get the ones that are red on the inside.  Oh! And get some plantains.  Yeah.  It's part of the banana family. It's a delicacy.  Yes! Oh look at this, these mangos are beautiful! Oh these are beautiful, you did good George.  This mango is delicious!  I only got hundreds.  Come on, come on, we're gonna pay you! Here have some mango.  Come on, take some. It's good.  I told you.  Want some mango?  So my mother's going out with this guy who leaves a jacket in          her house  No no, he's never met her. She's in California.  Oh, yeah yeah, I have to. I'm your fianc, Peter Von Nostrand.  Oh, I got stamped at the reggae lounge last night. Yeah, I'm          going  Yeah, I washed, just not the hand. You wouldn't believe the women          at  Well, you're as pretty as any of them, you just need a nose job.  What? What?  What? What do you mean? I just said she needs a nose job.  Well, I was just trying to help out.  You see what happens when you try to be nice?  Well I don't, I'm guessing.  You got butchered.  Wait, wait, wait, I'll go with you.  I don't have it, I threw it out.  I told you, I threw it out.  You told me not to give it to you, you made me promise.  You said, no matter what you do or say, I'm not to give you the          number.  No, you told me not to!  Alright! (flinging pieces of torn paper to the ground) Yeah!          Yeah!   Wait wait wait wait wait. (putting a ring on Elaine's finger)          Here.  Because we're engaged.  Um hm.  Yes, yes I am.  Uh, yes. Well, it's, uh, very intriguing.  My contention?  Yes, that's my contention.  She does fine work.  You don't say?  So I grabbed the guy by the collar.  Neither did I. We're off to the Reggae Lounge.  (Confused) What's up with you two?  (To Jerry) So how was the big trip?  (Observing Elaine's bandaged nose) Well, what happened                to your nose?  Well, you gotta give me something! Come on, how was the                wedding? Was the bride radiant?  (Interested) Ooohh.. That sounds juicy. Listen, I gotta                go to the bathroom, but I want to hear all about it. (Gets up and                heads for the bathroom)  Oh, thank you, FDR!  Alright, FDR.. This wish is for all the marbles. You win,                you get your wish - I drop dead. I win, I don't drop dead, and I                get one-hundred percent  Oh, man! Well, then, come on. There's got to be something                that'll change your mind, FDR. Something.." (FDR lifts up a                cooler, and puts it on the table)  Well, guess what, FDR? I made a wish on a shooting star                last night, and I wished against your wish.  Alright, I'm triple-wishing! Yep!  Alright.. (Pulls out one of his eyebrows) How do you like                this? (Blows it away) Ya!  (Tears out another eyelash) Ah! (Blows it away)  You shut up!  I mean, we had a deal, Newman. And you were supposed to                give my your birthday wish. And now you've wated it!  Does your girlfriend have to be here?  Alright, come on, Newman. Now you gotta help me! What am                I gonna do about FDR?  And how am I gonna do that, Toots?  (Interested) That's perfect..  (Shrugging Jerry off) Nah.  I can't. (Complaining) I'm gonna drop dead.  I'm goin' to Newman's!  (Knocking on a port-a-potty door) Come on, Lomez! We're                gonna be late for the movie.  Anything you wish.. I'll tell you a little secret about                zip codes: They're meaningless! (Laughs evilly, driving away)  Wish?! Newman!  Newman, wait!  Yeah, yeah. And thanks for inviting me!  Well, Newman, I need your wish to protect me from FDR.  Come on! Look, I'll give you my next birthday wish, huh?  Forty-eight.  Done!  Oh, geez..  (Walking away) I knew it.. Stupid Jerry..  But you haven't seen..  Yeah.. (Heads for FDR's)  Well, why?  Woah, wait, wait, wait. If you make a birthday wish out                loud, it doesn't come true.  Hey, FDR wants me to drop dead.  (To George) Yeah, Franklin Delano Romanowski. (Resumes                telling the story) I go to his birthday part, and just before he                blew out his candles, he gives  (Entroducing yet another type of look to the boys) EVIL                eye.  Yeah, well, I can't have this hanging over my head. It's                bad mojo.  Yeah!  Hey, hey. Yeah, check it out. It's packin' tight! (Puts                the snowball on the table, then drips water from Jerry's cup onto                it)  Oh, I need some water. Ice it up nice and hard.. and when                you throw it - Pop! Oh look, (Looks out the Monk's windows) there's                my friend, FDR. I'm  Oh, hey, how you doing?  Uh, no. Actually, it's Kramer.  Uh, you need any help, or..?  Uh, no, no, no. I couldn't impose.  (Eyeing Jerry's empty apartment) Really?  Whoa, you're dating this woman?   George, you're becoming one of the gliterratti   Ya' know, people who glitter. She's a slim gal.  Maybe she's bulimic  Bulimic,   Exactly  There you go monkey boy.  Here's your scrubber back.  Nothin'  Me?  No.  Well, now look, just leave me alone.  No, don't, don't make me  No, I can't, all right I can't ...   ... My mother's a matron!  Yeah, there, all right I said it there.. Ya' satisfied?                Anything else you   Look, George, I can't help ya, all right.  let me go. let me go. Because I haven't talked to my mother                in five  I can't I can't  (mumbles) b'd b'd  Ma?  What's so funny? ... wha?  All right, OK So you the name now. The cat is .a a a ..                out of the bag.  Well you know all my life I've been running away from that                name.   Hi Mr. Clotworthy  Ah couldn't be better. Hi Lorraine.  My mom Babs.  Yes, It's a fine day  Hey, everything my man.  You ma, know I've been thinking. I want you to quit that                matron job.  Well maybe we could go into business together. If you're                clean?  I've got plenty of ideas.  Hey.  Thanks man.  Uh, Yeah, yeah, but he's on vacation. Went to Baltimore.  Yeah  All right all right. Come on I'll take you over to Newman's  She quit.  Don't talk to me George, talk to her.  I don't know.  Ma!  It was there!  Hey, how about if the book came with these little fold-out legs...so          the book itself becomes a coffee table?  Danke schoen, my little dumplings.  Ooh, she's a package full of energy!  And that something is life. Jerry, you gotta meet this gal -          she's brimmin' with positivity!  Great, I'm gonna bring Toby.  Oh, she's a great laugher - right, Elaine?  Is that the waitress from the comedy club?  She's got a kid?  Hey, Jerry. Toby, this is Jerry.  What about me?  Alright, so you have a good show, huh buddy?  Look, she didn't mean anything.  She's just being enthusiastic, that's all!  Wait a second, what's happenin' here? Toby! Toby!  What did you go up there to heckle her for?  Oh, YEAH! You gave her a taste of medicine, alright.  Well, after he heckled Toby, she got so upset, she ran out of          the building and a street sweeper ran over her foot and severed her pinky          toe.  Yeah! Then after the ambulance left, I found the toe! So I put          it in a Cracker Jack box, filled it with ice, and took off for the hospital.  No, I jumped on the bus. I told the driver, "I got a toe          here, buddy - step on it."  Yeah, yeah, then all of a sudden, this guy pulls out a gun. Well,          I knew any delay is gonna cost her her pinky toe, so I got out of the          seat and I started walking towards him. He says, "Where do you think          you're going, Cracker Jack?" I said, "Well, I got a little prize          for ya, buddy - " <Kramer throws two quick punches and a massive          uppercut> - knocked him out cold!  Then everybody is screamin,' because the driver, he's passed          out from all the commotion...the bus is out of control! So, I grab him          by the collar, I take him out of the seat, I get behind the wheel and          now I'm drivin' the bus.  Yeah. Yeah, I am Batman. Then the mugger, he comes to, and he          starts chokin' me! So I'm fightin' him off with one hand and I kept drivin'          the bus with the other, y'know? Then I managed to open up the door, and          I kicked him out the door with my foot, you know - at the next stop.  Well, people kept ringin' the bell!  Well! I am happy to say that the little guy is back in place          at the end of the line.  Well, it's a valuable appendage.  Yeah, and you know what she told me? She said her first order          of business is to put my coffee table book into the bookstores as soon          as possible.  You know, throughout this whole thing, she always kept a smile          on her face.  Okay.  You can smell me without the drink.  Okay, well what am I drinking? What do you got?  All right.  That is *damn* good scotch. I could do a commercial for                this stuff. Mmmmm, boy that Hennigans goes down smooth. And afterwords                you don't even smell. That's right folks. I just had three shots                of Hennigans and I don't smell. Imagine, you can walk around drunk                all day. That's Hennigans, the no-smell, no-tell scotch.  Hey. (snuggling really close to George) I'm going to tell                you what I think. I know you don't care what I think, but I'm going                to tell you. I think that you are terrific.   Say you got a big job interview, and you're a little nervous.                Well throw back a couple shots of Hennigans and you'll be as loose                as a goose and ready to roll in no time. And because it's odorless,                why, it will be our little secret. (singing) h-e-double n...  What's that red dot on your sweater?  Hey! JoJo!  No, thank you. So what are you doing?  Come on, let's go to the beach.  What? It's a beautiful day.  Yeah, there's something in the air today. You feel it? There's something in the         air.  Yeah, there's something in the air.  Oh hey!  Oh, you missed it, buddy - lot of femininas - some major femininas  You know, I went swimming and I can't get this water out of my ear.  You're moving to California?  Yeah, but Jerry, what happens if the show's a hit? You could be out there for         years! You might never come  Jerry. It's L.A. Nobody leaves. She's a seductress, she's a siren, she's a         virgin, she's a whore.  Fling!  I say Japan.  Oh - geishas - they cater to your every whim. They're shy at first, but they're         quite skilled at conversation. They can discuss anything from world affairs to the fine         art of fishing - or baking.  Oh - Switzerland - the Von Trapp family, huh?  Oh yeah - oui oui.  The only way to fly.  Can't get rid of it. Maybe it leaked inside my brain.  I got to get it out, I can't take this anymore.  I lost my balance.  It was an accident.  I'm ready! I'm ready! Glory hallelujah!  We're straightening out!  I want to capture this.  All right, what's wrong with the plane we got? They're just checking it out.  What?  The Samaritans were an ancient tribe - very helpful to people.  Mmmm, this is pretty good chow, huh?  I still had it on video. We could have watched it later.  This is excellent huh? Don't worry I didn't use too much milk, cause I know we         gotta make it last.  I bet.  How bout me, Jackie?  Cool it, lady. Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.  Will you stop worrying? Jackie's going to get us off. He never loses. How about         when he asked that cop   I think it's going to be okay - that girl just smiled at me.  Could be fun. Don't have to worry about your meals, or what you're going to do         Saturday night. And they do shows. Yeah, we could put on a show - maybe "Bye Bye         Birdie" or "My Fair Lady". Elaine, you could be Liza Doolittle.  I got it - it's out! How about that, huh? Oh, boy, what a relief.  Hey, Seinfelds!   How long are you staying?   Oh yeah, yeah I heard, Marvin Kessler. Boy, that makes you think.          If he could go...   No, not giving. hoarding. I'm storing it in to a blood bank.          Just in case.   Jerry, I know myself. If I'm out on the street and it's starts          to go down, I don't back off until it's finished.   Done.   My service rates went up? You banks are all the same with your          hidden fees and your service charges. Well, maybe I'll just take my blood          elsewhere, yeah.   Oh, no no no...no more banks. I'm keeping my blood in my freezer          with...my money!   Hey buddy, I'm borrowing all your Tupperware.   I closed down my account at the blood bank.   Right across the hall. What, you wanna go see?   You know, for a fat guy you're not very jolly.   What the heck is going on here?   Well, I may have to take it, but I don't have to like it.   For me? Go...Yeah, what tonight? Yeah, I'll be there...Yeah later.          [puts the phone down] Well, somebody's baby-sitting.   Don't be ridiculous. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go to          fill my freezer with my own blood.   Hello, Vivian! Oh, this is a nice screen.   Don't take my money!   No, I'm the baby-sitter.   There was an incident.   Would you stop it.   It's Jell-O.   This is tomato juice, look...[drinks from the bottle.]   Will you calm down. I took all my blood down to Newman's. He          let me put it in his meat freezer.   Oh yeah yeah, George he came by and made more of those pudding          skin singles. They're delicious.   Heads up!   It's ok, Jerry. I'm right here.   That knife, it nicked your jugular. You know Jerry, when somebody          yells 'heads up', you're not supposed to actually look up.   Anyway, you were lucky that I was there. You lost a lot of blood.          Oh yeah, you've got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy.   Look at this, look at the hair on the back of my neck. It's all          bramble, see it's like thicket back there. Look, I need somebody to shave          it for me, huh?   Well, I have to say I'm very surprised and disappointed - blood          brother.   What? Jerry, I gave you my blood. Listen to your pulse, [takes          Jerry hand] hey buddy-hey buddy-hey buddy...   So, my blood is not enough. Would you like a kidney too, because          I'll give it to you? I'll rip it out right here and stack it on the table!          No no no, I don't have time right now. I'll catch you tonight,          we'll do sort of an all over kind of thing, all right?   Well, maybe if you called more often, I wouldn't have to. Listen,          is it all right if I watch a tape in here?   Well, I'm taping Canadian Parliament, you know on C-Span.   Is it all right if I watch it in your bedroom, cause your bed          is really nice?   Ok!   Blood!   We're making sausages.   Yeah, an instructional video about how to make your own sausages.          All right, all right. Newman, let's go grab some mail sacks and          haul these beauties out of here.   Why did you get rid of that sausage?   Yeah well, Newman's not happy, he booted me out of his freezer.          Look, I've got to take my blood back to the bank, can I borrow your car?          I got no A/C and I gotta keep the blood cold or it'll go bad.          All right, Even Steven. Oh, by the way, when you get back to          your apartment try to keep it down because Newman is taking a nap in your          bed.   Oh, man...[looks to the glove compartment for a manual.] "If          the engine begins to overheat, turn off air conditioner". Never,          I can't do that.   Oh, mama...   Shees, come on...[opens the radiator]..this thing is bone dry.          [Looks at the blood.]   That kid...   Jerry, it was overheating. You should take better care of that          thing.   You didn't get the blood from me.   All right, Coney Island. Ok, you can take the B or the                F and switch  Well, yeah...  Jerry, come on let's go, pick up the check so we can go.  Yeah.  Well, let's see: speeding, running a red light, no license,                no  I'm fighting that one. You know, this is gonna cost me                over six  I've gotta go to court, I'll get in trouble. What's the                matter with  Oh yeah, it's all set. They got the bug boy on him.  Yeah, the little father has run his hard out. They're gonna                break  Oh, this baby loves the slob, loves it, eats it up. Eats                the slob.  His mother was a mudda'.  What did I just say?  Hey,all right, 600 Pappanick to win.  Yes! Yes! I won, hey (shouts to cashier)  What happened?  Wait, wait, wait...  Hey! George.....Lily..

No , no no no no. Weddings are a great place to meet chicks.                I have to be unfettered.  All right, All right. Lets get down here. You really want                to get out of this thing ?  All right. I got two words for you; Pre-Nup.  Ask her to sign a pre-nup.
