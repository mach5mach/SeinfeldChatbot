You told them that?  This is so fantastic. I don't know how to thank you.  Oh, probably caught in traffic.  There's no Rubber Man.  I'm leaving.  To Rava's house. I've gotta pick up her manuscript.  (To Rava) So, the meeting with Lippman is all set. He's the editor-in-chief!          I think because of your request..  Jerry? ..Jerry!  What statue?  You have a statue? I never saw a statue.  Since when?  Do you realize what you're saying?  Are you sure?  Ninety-nine percent sure?!  Maybe it just looks the same. Maybe it's just a coincidence.  I never saw the statue.  I don't know.  Oh Jerry, don't blow this for me.  (Takes the manuscript) Oh, see you tomarrow morning.  Well, then, if he's crazy you should just forget it.  George, do you realize that Rava's asked me to edit her book?  No!  (Scrambling) Alright, look, look, look, Let's say he stole it.  C'mon, you can't do anything about it. The cops won't do anything.          What, are you going to fight him? Why don't you just.. forget it?  Nervous?  Yeah. Right.  The book is great. Did you go out last night?  They all are..  I can't remember..  Oh, well, I'm staying out of this one. This is between them.          I am not getting involved.  Well, you have to admit.. the circumstantial evidence.  Well, I mean, he was in the apartment, and then it's gon and          it's in your apartment.  No, no.. but it is quite a coincidence.  A big coincidence.  No, that's a big coincidence.  No, there are degrees of coincidences.  Shouldn't you be out on a ledge somewhere?  Why don't we just throw a Molotov cocktail through their window?  Well, how do you think I feel? Instead of editing the first novel          of a major young writing talent, I am proofreading a food allergy cookbook.  I did. He loves Rava.. worse.. he loves Ray, and he doesn't think          you're funny at all.  Where is this guy?! (Checks her watch) I hate                this! (Sighs) I shoulda brought something to read.. (Picks up a                sugar packet) "Cancer in labratory animals"..  Yeah?  (Shocked) Stabbed?!  That is not the point! The guy was stabbed!  Yeah, (Nodding) It turns out it was his ex-girlfriend.  Well, I don't know.. I mean, think about it,                Jerry. There must be something exciting about this guy if he can                arouse that kind of passion. (Obviously turned  Andrea Doria? Isn't that the one they did                the song about?  I think Gordon Lightfoot was the boat.  I love shrimp! (Waves her knife around as                she's talking) I'm a shrimp eater. You put shrimp infront of me,                (Waves her knife along with her hand gestures.  (Leans in close) Between you and me, what                happened there with the stabbing?  What? Was she just so crazy in love with you                that she just couldn't take it anymore? Or..?  (Gets up, pointing after Carol) Was that the                one?! Was that the one who stabbed you?!  Right, so, I called my friend, you know -                the one who set us up - I found out, he's a bad-breaker-upper.  (Fast) Well, you know when you break up, how                you say things you don't mean? Well, he says the mean things you                don't mean, but he means them.  Dump him. I can't be with someone who doesn't                break up nicely. I mean, to me, that's one of the most important                parts of a relationship.  (Confused by his sudden change-of-heart) What?                Break-up? We went out on one date.  (Shows no sign that she cares) Alright, good.                Good.  Pardon?  (Laughing out loud) That's it?! (Laughs again)                That's the best you got?! (Laughs loudly as Alan exits)  Hawaii? That's why you're helping Newman with                the mail?  Well, anyway, get this: I spoke to Alan. You                know, I told him I didn't want to see him anymore.. He called me                "big head".  (Agreeing) It's one of the nicest things anyone's                ever said to me.  Is he not gonna go to the coffee shop?  (Gives a "That's a shame" face)                Alright, well, I'll see ya. (Opens the door to exit. Kramer enters                coughing. Elaine does her best to dodge out of the way of  What?  (Rubbing her head to relieve the pain) Really?  Nothing.. Except that a bird ran into my giant                freak-head. (Sits down)  (Annoyed, near tears) The one that sits atop                my disproportunately puny body.. I'm a walking candy apple!  (Realizing) What? Yeah.. you're right!.. All                I have to do is call him up, and sit with him, and show him that                it doesn't bother me. You know, laugh it off.. or  (Getting up to leave) Alright.  (Shrugging it off) Oh, please.  (Casually playing along) So what?  (Suddenly angry) What?!  It's me.  I didn't get it.  Hello!  I'm sorry, I didn't know you had company. I just wanted                to return your tape.  I'm sorry, I really am. I just kept forgetting.  No, no, I'm leaving.  Oh yeah? This woman was selling them at this crazy party                I was at last night. You'll appreciate this. Snapple?   I was talking to this guy, you know, and I just happened                to throw my purse on the sofa. And my diaphragm goes flying out.                So I just froze, you know, ahh! Staring at my diaphragm. You know,                it's just lying there. So then, this woman, the one who sold me                this hair thing, she grabbed it before the guy noticed, so. I mean,                big deal, right? So I carry around my diaphragm, who doesn't? Yeah,                like it's a big, big secret that women carry around their diaphragms.                You never know when you're gonna need it, right? (Sips the Snapple)                Ahh.   What? Was it something I said?  Well I didn't know.  Well you think I should say something? Should I say something?                Should I apologize? Was I being anti-virgin?  'Cause I'm not anti-virgin. I'll be right back. (She leaves)  Look, Marla. This whole sex thing is totally overrated.                Now, here's the one thing you've gotta be ready for is how the man                changes into a completely different person five seconds after it's                over. I mean, something happens to their personality it's really                quite astounding. It's like they committed a crime and they want                to flee the scene before the police get there.  Yeah, pretty much, yeah. Well, the smart ones start working                on their getaway stories during dinner. How, you know, they gotta                get up early tomorrow. What is about being up early? They all turn                into farmers suddenly.  Eh.  There was a bit of an accident.  Marla and I went out for coffee and afterwards I was crossing                the street and he was biking right towards me. So I got out of the                way just in time, but then he ran into a parked car. He hit his                head and everything went flying.  You should slow down, you know that? It's dangerous to                go that fast.  (To Ping) I did not jaywalk.  Nothin'. I was just givin' her the straight dope.  Listen, there was a lot more I could've told her, believe                me.  You might've if I'd stayed. So you know what? I got served                with papers today. Ping is suing me. I need your virgin as a witness.                You better be nice to her.  Look at George. (On the other side of the restaurant) He                lucked out, huh?  Yeah, since she met him she's been vomited on, her family                cabin's been burned down, she learned her father's a homosexual,                and she got fired from a high paying network job. Yeah, they had                a real good thing going.  Mono? Huh, well, if anyone needs any medical                advise, Elaine met a doctor. And he's unattached.  No, it's not debunked, it's totally bunk.  Huh?  Look it, I'm dating a doctor and I like it.                Let's just move on. (Phone rings)  So do most doctors like ER or do you guys                just think it's fake?  Oh, yeah. And I'm not really attracted to                you.  When do you take this exam?  Well, you're basically a doctor. Right? I                mean, people do call you doctor.  Well, can I introduce you as doctor?  All right, that's all I wanted to know.  So when they're handing you those cadavers,                do you get to choose whether it's a man or a woman?  Oh my God.   It's Sue Ellen Mischke, this old braless friend                I hate. (Elaine tries to cover her face)  Oh hi, Sue Ellen.  Well, this is my boyfriend, doctor Ben Gelfen.  Hey, stop kidding me. He's a doctor. He's                a very good doctor.  Well, there's a doctor right here.  Can't you at least tell him what to do?  I hope Carlitto feels better. Ben really wishes                he could've helped.  Oh he is. Kind of. I mean, I call him doctor.                (She walks away and sees George sitting down reading books) George.                (He holds up his hand to signal her to wait a second.)  What? What is with all these books?  What is your answer to number 74?  No! Hypocalimia, not medibolic acidosis. Duh!  Oh yes you are. We'll just stop having sex.  Portuguese?  How come he's gettin' so smart? I stopped                having sex with Ben three days ago and I don't know no Portuguese?  I don't know. It's just the last coupla days                my mind has been, not good.  What? What are you talking about?  I don't understand.  Hey, Ben. I need a four letter word. Winnie                the blank.  Pooh...(laughing)  Not good. I'm a moron.  Well, that kinda brings us to why I'm here.                You got eleven minutes?  I just wanna clear my head. It has nothing                to do with you.  You could read the paper through the whole                thing if you want.  Oh, all right. Is Kramer home?  Congratulations! You passed!  What? you're breaking up with me? But I sacrificed                and supported you while you struggled. What about my dream of dating                a doctor?  Look it, are we going to have sex, or not?  Mm-hm.  (Smiling, chewing) Who, me?  (Matter-of-factly) They have to, it's in the Geneva Convention.  (Making a face of surprise) You mean..?!  (Wide-eyed) So, she fell?  No, I guess you couldn't have..  (Finishing it off) ..done that.  (Between chuckles) How is she?  (Still laughing) Ok, I'm sorry.  (Stifling her laughter) I know. I'm sorry. I'm serious.  What, you mean, in your mother's house, or all together?  Oh, gimme a break..  (Smiling) I want to be in on this, too.  Why?  What? Why? (More 'no, no, no's from Jerry and George. Persistent)                Why?  So what?  (Sarcastic) Oh.  Oh, that is such bologna. I shave my legs.  Yeah!  No, I'll - I'll put up one-fifty.  It's me.  Hey.  Well, (Smiling) where's my money? Who caved?  What're you looking at?  (Smiling, chuckling) This is gonna be the easiest money                I've ever made in my life. (Moving on to a new topic) So, my fried,                Joyce, is teaching an aerobics  (Realizes Jerry and George aren't paying attention) So                then, I got a call this morning. You know, I was, uh, chosen to                go on the space shuttle. We're goin'  What?!  Well, that was fast!  ..And then there were three.  I don't understand you. I really don't. You have nothing                better to do at three o' clock in the afternoon? I go out for a                quart of milk, I come home, and find  Oh, it's been a while.  (Fake excitement) Yeah. yeah, I'm really.. psyched.  Why is that?  (Between breaths) Oh, my God. (Joyce nods) John F. Kennedy                Junior's here!  (Still unable to speak right) In my class? John Kennedy's                gonna be in my class?!  Yeah. Butt. Butt. Great butt. John-John's butt.  John F. Kennedy Jun-ya!  (Smiling) He was in my aerobics class.  No, you don't understand - he was working out right in                front of me. So, listen, after the class was over, I timed my walk                to the door so we'd get there at  (Smiling, proud) I said, "yeah."  So then, listen, listen. So then, I showered and I dressed,                and I saw him again, on the way out. (Giddy and nearly out of breath)                So we're walkin' and  (Sets the glass down) I'm queen of the castle. (Pops a                piece of food into her mouth)  Hi.  No, I just, uh, fixed it.. a little bit. (Still looking                around, she quickly checks her breath)  (Regarding herself) What? What? Who? Me-me-me? I made an                impression? What impression?  No! No! Now! Tell me now! What did he say?!  (Ecstatic) He asked about me? John Kennedy asked about                me?! (Hangs off the side of the counter, both feet in the air) What                did he say?  (Quick) What situation? I have a situation?  That was good. That was very good.  (Frank) Okay, you tryin' to hurt me? Are you tryin' to                hurt - you're tryin' to injure me, right? You're trying to hurt                me.  (Through intercom) It's Elaine.  Hello.. (Pulls a wad of bills out of her purse, and starts                to count it up)  It was..uh.. John-John.  Yeah, but yesterday, he told Joyce, the aerobics teacher,                that he wants to meet me outside here at nine o' clock tonight.  Because he think I live here. Remember when we shared a                cab, and he dropped me off out in front? He's picking me up.  (Slowly) Elaine Benes Kennedy Junior..  Marla? Hi, oh, I'm glad I ran into you-  What happened?  Ohh. Boy, she's a whack-o.  What?  (Let down) He didn't show.  What? He's - He's out there? Oh, my God. I-I gotta go,                I gotta go..  What?  (Angered) He left with Marla, the virgin?  They drove away?  (Makes a sound of surprise) Is that..?  He's waving..  Hey Walter what is the deal with that guy?  You've been an enormous help.  Hey. What's going on?  No, Castro.  All because of this creepy new guy at work. He just - he                just comes out of nowhere and he's right   That's right! He's a real sidler.  You never see him. He sidled me again in my office. I was                sitting there making a cup of soup  I thought I was alone.  Would you just let it go?  Phew! This chair smells like garbage.  <giggles>  Mr. Peterman, here are these pages that you wanted.  What?   Jerry  Well, I'll tell ya, this sidler guy is really chapping                my hide.  Well, he's getting credit for work I did! He's gonna sidle                me right out of a job.  Kramer, what is wrong with you?  Well, for starters, you're looking at note cards <to                Jerry> I'm gonna have to give that guy a taste   Not with these honeys. ... Wrestling shoes!  <quietly standing behind Lou> Thank you. ha ha   Well, I guess we'll just <Lou has left> Hey, just                gimme that.   Yes, Lou. you've got a lot going for you. You're, ... um                ... you're spontaneous. You're   No. Your. <breathes>  Eechh.   Well, you should never ever go anywhere without these.                <Tic Tacs>  Hey! ha ha Nice sidle, huh? Speaking of which I think I                got that problem solved.  He's a human maraca.  You took him over to Celia's?  What about the woman who's been drugged and taken advantage                of?  I think it's unconscionable.  EZ Bake oven?  Who wants cupcake?  Why is your father giving a tour of a rest stop?  What?  No, no, Mr. Peterman that wasn't me!  No Mister Peterman.  Lou! In here! We have to talk.  <Takes the Tic Tacs away from Lou> No, stop it! Bad                voodoo. You gotta stop using these.  Because they're turning your teeth green?  Okay ... well then your teeth are green for a different                reason. Just stop carrying these, okay?   Binacca?  Right, right, cankers. Um, I got it! Chew gum!  Well, stinky, this is your lucky day.  Oh well, hey, I dated Jerry too. I know what a monster                he can be. More wine and turkey?  Oh, he's nobody. Hey, listen, ... let me top that off for                y'a.  Julia Louis- Dreyfus  Hi boys.

Bummer...Okay , good luck finding her . I'm taking off.  Home.  Well , I just came from the gym , unless I can shower at                your place.  (coming out of the shower in a bathrobe) May be she realized                she could never have you and she jumped off  No.  ( to Kramer who just got in with his camcorder) Ooooh!                You're taping.  Aah! Okaaay.  ( to the camera) Hi. How 're you doin'?  Oh. it's always simulated....except with George that's                in my contract.  Thanks for driving me home.

Hello.. so did you ever find out who that woman was?  I guess you figure you're in for a pretty wild night?  Well listen I'm going to (?) do you want me to stop by?  Jerry...Jerry listen I got too much stuff this afternoon,                I can't come over, forget it.  So humm....When you gonna call her?  Good luck.  Hi, It's Elaine is this a bad time?   ( Concerned) What's the matter?  ( to George returning) Hi George. Something stinks in here.(                George motions to Jerry, she nods)  I was the one who talked into your tape recorder.  That was nothing.  What is it?  It was a joke...  Aah.... ( she stares at the three of them all lined up                like the Daltons ,all looking at her  [OC] Not only didn't you love her, you didn't even like              her.  You did.  Dana Folley.  Yeah, she's terrific. Why? You thinking of going?  Tia? Who's that?   She sent you a Christmas card?   ... date with Fred.  He's not THAT religious.  See, she was clever. You know she put her picture on a              card. I should do that. I never do anything like that.   No, no, I was just thinking out loud I don't want my picture              on a card.  Really? Can you really take a picture?  All right, ha ha   Why? What's wrong with it?  Anyway so Fred and I are going to do some volunteer work              for that Church on Amsterdam.  It was no trouble. My assistant did the whole thing.  Well, you know. It's a picture?  Yeah, well. How hard is it to take a picture?  What?  Carefully?  What?  (gasps) Oh my God! That's my nipple.   That's my nipple. My nipple's exposed. I sent this card              to hundreds of people! My parents. My boss. Uh, Nana and Papa.   Oh God I didn't notice. Oh, what am I going to do? You                know your whole life you go through painstaking efforts to hide                your nipple and then BOOM, suddenly hundreds of people get their              own personal shot of it.   Have you seen the card?   This car.  Well did you notice anything unusual about it?  Well come here and take a look.   So, what's that?  Right!!  Aw, great!? Didn't you see that?   It's because you made me wear that stupid shirt.   No. I don't want him looking.  Oh my God. I sent one to the super in my building. My mailman.                My ten year old little nephew. Sister Mary Catherine. Father Chelios.              Oh my God Fred! I sent one to Fred.  (OC) It's me.   You cannot believe what I'm going through. That card is                plastered all over the office. Everybody is calling me, Nip! ...                Yeah. That's my new nickname at the office. Nip! These guys keep                asking me out for drinks. Not only that, Fred, you know the guy                I told you about? He hasn't called me in three days. ... [sees card]              Oh please!  You want a Christmas card? You want a Christmas card? All                right here. [rubs George's head on her breasts] Here's your Christmas              card.   What, Ocean.  I told you, Fred - my friend's next door neighbor took              it.  Well, I-I-I must a missed a button. I forgot to button              it.  Oh, you've never missed a button?! (Phone rings, she puts              it on speakerphone) Yeah?..  Oh, God - my nephew. (Picks up the phone and hits the button)              Hi, Gail!.. Yu.. yu... Yes, Gail, I know how old he is.  Yeah, take it! Take it!.. An' stop calling me "Nip"! (Co-worker                takes it and quickly leaves. Elaine goes back to the phone) It was              an accident! Well..  I did not bare myself deliberately, but I tell you, I wish                now that I had! (Fred, shocked by her speech, flees. She calls after                him, still standing at the hallway) Because it is not me that has              been exposed, but you! For I have seen the nipple on your soul!  The pick?  Oh my!  I'm not sure but... I think I see your...  Uh, no, thanks.  You know, there are 200 people who work in this office.                Every day is somebody's special day.  It's his birthday and it's his last day?  All right, pile it on.  It is the forced socializing. I mean, just because we work                in the same office, why do we have to act like we're friends?  I had to take a sick day. I'm so sick of these people.                By the way, I talked to Lisi, and tomorrow night's good for her.  Yeah, you're better off sitting around here, reading comic                books, and eating spaghetti at two in the morning..  Your old high school hangout? Why?  Wait a minute, wait a minute. Who is the Lopper?  Really? What're the other titles?  What is this?  Stop it! That's not even a song! I mean, now we're celebrating                a sick day?  What? What is nice? Trying to fill the void in your life                with flour and sugar and egg and vanilla? I mean, we are all unhappy.                Do we have to be fat, too? Not you Becky, I know you have a slow                metabolism. I don't want one more piece of cake in my office!  So how's it going with my friend?  Oh, it's a cake party. It's the third one today. I didn't                realize how hooked I got on that 4:00 sugar rush.  I can't. I denounced them. Maybe I'll go raid Peterman's                fridge. He's always got a truffle or something in there.  Anybody here? Peterboy?  Ooh, it's a cake walk.  Mr. Peterman, um--  No, sir, I can't.  Guess what I ate.  No. A $29,000 piece of cake. Peterman got it at The Duke                Of Windsor auction. It was the most romantic thing I've ever eaten.  A little stale.  Hey, so I talked to Lisi and she has got a big surprise                for you. She's planning a weekend trip to Pennsylvania Dutch country.  4:00 sugar fix.  No, no. You are way past the phone call breakup stage.  Oh...it's daylight. It won't take you that long. Just make                a clean break.  Just a little off the side...  Well, no point in wasting $1,200.  Do you have anything that's been...you know, laying around                for a while? Something prewar would be just great.  Oh, Kramer, I am in big. big, big trouble. I need a cake                that looks like this.  Do any of these look close?  Entenmann's? From the supermarket?  Oh, hello.  I guess I'll just--  Mr. Peterman, you wanted to see me, sir?  Um...as far as I know.  Uh, I guess I hadn't--  Kramer, Hi, I thought you went to California.  Oh, shut up (pushes Kramer)  Really?  Who's suitcase is this?  Oh, golly, it's probably from sleeping on that sofa.  You lie.   Hu hu, ha.  Oh, he's fine.  Yeah, you know (scratches cheek)  What, Uh ih?  What?  What tell? What's a tell?  Um, uh, who's it going with, uh, Alice?  How high did I go?  Well not quite.   He was my psychiatrist, you know. He knows all my patterns. In          my relationships I always try to find some reason to leave, so as my doctor,          he can't allow me to do this, so he's not letting me leave.  He has this power over me, okay. He has this way of manipulating          every little word I say. He's like a Svenjolly.  What did I say?  Svenjolly? I did not say Svenjolly.  I don't see how I could have said Svenjolly.  No, it's not going to work with this guy.  I don't think so.  I am sorry but there's somebody else.  Well it's nothing I planned on happeniong, you knoe. It just          kind of happened.   Well, there's not really much to tell, you know, he's just a          guy. Really.  . . . Years. Years, um, we've been close friends and then recently          something you know just happened.   Yeah, yeah. Sexu-ally.  Well, I was just telling you about this other guy.   Yeah. Yeah, (cough, cough) ha um.  Oh, don't concern yourself with me, because I'm good. I'm very          good, I mean I'm really very very good.   . . . no.  His name?  Um, what's the difference?  No, no, I just don't see how that's relevant.   Uh, his name, uh, Idon't even know, all right you want to know          his name? I'll tell you his name. His name is . . . Kramer.  Oh, I'm really uncomfortable talking about this.   What?  Oh, no, no no no, I can't do that.  No, I can't.   Okay, okay. I'll have Kramer give you a call.  Yeah. What, is it a problem?  Well, I guess he figured you just wouldn't care. It *has*                been a  Oh, god.  Oh, yeah. Right, right. Well, all those mechanics do is                work all  Fine.  No.  No, nothing.  I was with David *Putty* last night.

Oh, he's come up with some other move. You should see this                thing.  Oh, it's a lot of just fancy-shmancy stuff. You know what                it's  I mean, this move is no good, Jerry. It's just taking up                a lot of  Yes. As a matter of fact, there is.  I'm not surprised.  Why?  An estimate? How am I supposed to do that?

You think it                could have something  Oh, it's George. I bet you this is somehow George related.  He's like a virus. He attaches himself to a healthy host                company, and the  All right, Jerry, if that's not what it is, you tell me.                What is it?  Oh yeah, sure, sure. So, did ya have a good time at the                party last night?  Hey, did you happen to speak to my friend George?  Ah hah. Well, listen. You would be wise to keep your distance                from him.  Oh he's not. He's very harmful.  Oh trust me. He's a bad seed. He's a horrible seed. He's                one of the worst  Yeah, we're good friends.  Hey, have you seen Anna?  To meet George? I knew it. Where did they go?  Don't you see? George is in the bloodstream! You stay away                from him, too!  (To George) Stay away from her.  (To Anna) Get in the car.  You heard me young lady, get in the car. (To George) And                you, you should know better. I don't want you infecting my staff.  What?  At Yankee Stadium?  Oh really? 'Cause it looks a little big for you. It looks                like something a short, stocky, slow-witted, bald man might wear.  Who did that? Who did that?!?  Well, I have lost complete control of my staff. Why did                I let George go to that party? I mean, we were having so much fun.                We were wining, we were dining, we were dancing. (She starts dancing,                Kramer flips out) What?  It's dancing.  I dance fine.  He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. (Jerry fake laughs)                Jer?

Uh, well, listen. I feel really horrible about trying to                keep you two apart and I just wanted to apologize.  Well, George, I just want you to hear me say to Anna that                you're a good and decent person.  I never should have given Anna the impression--  --that you're a bad seed, I mean, you're a fine seed.  What?  I'm trying to help. Why are you being so difficult?  George, I don't have time for this. Uh, Anna, do you wanna                talk to George?  No, she doesn't want to. Okay, bye, George. We'll see ya.  Anna...  All right. Well, we'll talk about it tomorrow at the office.

Yeah. Can you hold my seat? <Elaine gets up.>  Well, you know, grace is a tough one. I like to think I have          a little grace...not as much as Jackie -   O.K., fine, I have...no grace.  Well, I have no intention of "getting" grace.  Yeah, yeah, right.  Justin Pitt?  "Mrs. Onassis's"? That's hard to pronounce.  Nothing. <Mr. Pitt comes in with some papers in hand.>  I was a great admirer of Mrs. Onass-sis-sis-sis...  Well, a lot of people have brown eyes.  Grace?  You think   Just some?  Yeah! And the best part is, I still get to look for work in publishing.  I attend to his personal affairs.   Well, like tomorrow for example, I have to uh...I have to buy          him some socks.  Yeah.

But that's so sick.  Anyway,                so how was the dinner?  What about                Georgie?  What?  I got                a date.  Oh, Mr.                Peterman.

But I didn't know, Tom. I g -- can't you just make an exception?  Ohh! Well, you're just gonna have to hold this for me.                Oh, no...please don't go. Please - please don't walk away.  Oh, Kramer! Thank God. I really appreciate you doing this.  Do you need anything?  Mulligatawny?  Oh! Who? The Soup Nazi?  All right. I'll be back.  Oh, no. No. No. No. I got it.  Hey, I got it. Hey. Didn't you already get soup?  Why? What happened?  [laughing]  Yeah. No. Listen, George, I am quite certain I'm walking                out of  Oh, I know! It is awful!  I don't know.  Ohh!  Ohh! Stop it! I know.  Ugh!  You know, we should say something.  I mean, why does he do that? Doesn't he know what a huge                turnoff  Yeah.  No. Me neither.  Oh, God!  Hi there.

Street toughs took my armoire?  I can't believe this!  Wha -- the Soup Nazi threw me out.  So, essentially, you chose soup over a woman?  Yeah. You know what I just realized? Suddenly, George has                become  Yeah. Come on. I mean, think about it. He's engaged to                be married.  Yeah. All right. You made the right decision.   Hey.  There he is.   Yeah. I know. Me, too.  No. In what way?  I don't think George has ever thought he's better than                anybody.  Hello.  One of these days that guy is gonna get his.   [gasps]  Oh! Oh, I love it! I absolutely love it!  The K Man did it!  [laughing] How much did you pay for this thing?  What?  What? Who's was it? Where'd you get it?  Get out!  The Soup Nazi gave it to you?  Why?  [gasps]  Well, I'm just gonna go down there and personally thank                him. I  Hi. You know, Kramer gave me the armoire and it is so beautiful.  I mean, you know, I've never been so insulted in my entire                life.  Let me see this. [gasps] You know what this is? This is                a recipe  So? So, his secret's out. Don't you see? I could give these                to  What do you care?  Get out of my way, Jerry.  Don't make me hurt you, Jerry.  Hello.  I don't want soup. I can make my own soup. " 5 cups                chopped Porcine  Yeah, that's right. I got 'em all. Cold cucumber, corn                and crab  You're through Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for                you. Next!  "Ah! So he knew that you were making it up.!"  "That's ridiculous. Why do do you want to go back                there if you don't want the coat?"  "But you were!!"  "What house guest?"  "Who is he?"  "What is a wig master?"  (looking up to the salesman)  ".....Hi."  "Oh!!.....Joseph Aboud .. and look at this hand ticking                around the crest."  "Well I'm in the biz .. I work for J. Peterman."  (giggling) "Ohhh!!."  "Ohhh!! really ..well you know what, I write those."  "Yeeeahh!!!"  "I think it's great. I think you should get it."  (laughs and giggles like a schoolgirl)  "But I really did like it"  "uhn... Sorry!"  "What is the big deal!!"  "He dared...."  "How do you like working there at the .... hum...Andover                shop?"  "except for Jerry!"(laughs)  "Oh!!!"  "Yeah..Yeah..."  "Really....but I barely know you."  "Ah! Ah!ah!  "Hey Jerr..."  "You were wrong about Craig . He's a very sweet guy."  "what about it?"  "All I know he's promised me a discount on that dress."  "Ah! Jerry I've been around long enough to know when                I'm being worked."  "I just met him this morning."  "Ok...."  "OKAY!!!"  "You know... I can't wait to get that dress.."  "Arrive?"  "But you said it was in the store!."  "But I thought .. Nicole Miller was made......."  "Hi E-an"  "E-an"  "Oh..Nice to meet you."  "Bye Eeeen."  "So you're giving him a discount too?"  "Hem!! No reason."  "Hi!."  "Squire's walking stick. I had to write about it for                the catalogue."  "You want it?"  "You can have ,I don't need it anymore."  "Ok so ..I am positive you are wrong about Craig."  "Because he told a man he'd give him a discount too...                a man Jerry."  "Some friend of his from England."  "You're nuts!"  "Aawwh Please....."  "Well you guys are gonna have fun here so..bye take                care"  "Well, Here we are."  "So.ehmmmm. so, do you have any ideas when the Nicole                Millers are coming in?"  "Huh!  "Hummm.... so you've no idea when.. they'll arrive."  "Hello."  "Uhmmm huh! Is it important.?  "Let me ask you something. ahemm..Do you know when                the Nicole Millers are coming in from  (sarcastically) Oh! yeah I'll make sure he gets the message."  Hey.   Look, this is crazy, I can't go on like this.   I need some space.   I hate this.   No, I don't want this anymore.   I can't breath...I'm sorry...[Elaine wakes up] You're killing          me!   [Banging the wall] Turn your alarm off!! [Screams]   Hey.   Yeah, that's pretty good.   Sara Sitarides?   Oh...[falls in to the sofa.]   You remember that next door neighbor of mine, the apartment that          always smells like potatoes?   This jackass goes to Paris, leaves the alarm on. It's been beeping          since 3:30 this morning.   How do you do that?   I know, I know, this is it. [points to a door.]   I think I'll let you do it.   No, I really don't want to.   I thought you had done this before.   Well, how are we gonna do it?   Are you okay?   The cat.   Kramer, my neighbor has a cat. When you blew the power, we must've          shut off the automatic feeder.   What did he do about it?   Well, this meowing is absolutely worst than the alarm.   Yeah, how's the doctor date?   Well, she's very focused. Dermatology is her life.   Yes, she's a dermatologist.   Where are we going?   Can it cut that thin?   How did you know you cut it?   Hold on kitty, dinner's coming.   Alright, let's do it.   Come on, come on kitty...[slice disappears] ooh...how about that;          it worked! Wow, can I borrow that thing for a while?   Why not?   What do I have to know?   Right there.   Right there.   You were right Kramer, this slicer is absolutely amazing...yeah,          yeah...no no no I'll bring it by tonight...ok bye.   These heals are so uneven. [Watches the slicer.]   Pliers?   Got it.   I...eh...I got a piece a my heal stuck in a slicer.   Okay, I got a little slicer happy, but listen; don't tell Kramer,          okay? He has very strong feelings for it.   Of course she treats skin cancer. That's how I met her, she was          doing a skin cancer screening at Peterman. That's what dermatologists          do.   Aha.   I don't know, I guess.   You have a little thing for this fella'?   Aah, I forgot it. I gotta get home.   Umm, I'm not actually going straight to home, I have to first          stop at the eh...circus, you know with all the...clowns.   Out, damn heal!   Kramer?   Just hold on!   Nothing...[heal comes loose and Elaine opens the door.] Here,          ok I'm on the phone alright? I'm on the phone with someone...   Phone call! I'm in a big phone call!   Oh, that's fantastic.   This is it. I can take this anymore.   Yeah, hello is this Allied Lock Smith?! Oh, finally, listen I          need someone to come over here right away!   I am getting a lock smith, alright?! Relax!   Yeah, the address is 78th West...   Um, what was that last thing you gave me? That was pretty good.          Can I have a zip? [Sticks a straw out from keyhole.]   I don't know.   What's that?   "I'm very imPRESSED"? ... Ah you mean pressed                caus' its like a dry cleaner?   Well, what about the sleeping arrangements? In the Cabin!  What about me?  Uh, thats, ...  A bubble?  Oh, sure.  Here <giving out paper napkins>  Who has the remote?  The remote goes through the bubble?   Yeah, of course, yeah.  Jerry! Of course he'd pay him a visit. You'd be happy to.  hey, what's with George and Susan? Does he actually like                her?  Oh, that's nice!  Well you know George. It's not enough to get there. you                gotta make good time.   Isn't that blue car him?   It's no big deal Jerry. We'll just meet him at the bubble                boy's house.   Wa',you don't have the directions?   How could you not take the directions?   Poor little bubble boy. He's sitting there waiting for                you in his bubble, or igloo thing or whatever.  Just get off at this exit. We'll figure somethin' out.                Your whole weekend? What about the bubble boy?   I'll just have a glass of water.   Why not? That's all I want.  YES! yes. You saw him on TV.   Jerry Seinfeld.  Right. Hey, wouldn't you like an autographed picture?   He's lying. They're in the trunk <takes car keys >                Now you get to sign another one.   Yeah, he is. <as she leaves>  Where's my water?  Waddya' write?  THIS is what you came up with?   That is so lame. Jerry, people are going to be reading                that for the next twenty years and laughing at you.  This chicken is really good.  Hi.  Argh, look at the fire! <cough>  The CABIN is on fire!  How could this have happened?  Na.  Do you realize this is the last meal I am going to have for three          days?  I dont know. How could I possibly have ulcers? Who could          have given me ulcers?  Hey, have you ever fasted?  What guy?  Oh, that creepy guy?  Maybe Ill get a steak with french fried onion wings.  Hey, George, you know my friend goes to a psychic.  Uh uh, you should go some time.   I wonder what Ghandi ate before his fast.  Really?  Why would he come to George?  Take it away.  Should you be smoking?  Youre pregnant.  Its really bad for the fetus. Do you know that.  Now listen. I just dont know how a person, with everything          we now know about pre-natal care can put a cigarette in her mouth.   Its disgusting.  Oh fine, I dont like to be around people who are just so          irresponsible.  [jumps with fear to Jerry] Did you see that wall move?  Hi, I havent eaten in three days. I was wondering how much          longer it would be until I get my X-ray.  How do we know that dog food is any good? Who tastes it?   Kramer  And there it was, mountains of duck. And not fatty duck either,          but juicy tender breasts of duck.   Assassins! How dare they keep a person waiting like this!           Drakes Coffee Cake?  Give me that.  Its Elaine.  Hey Boys-O!  Remember Roy, the artist?  Exactly, the "triangle" guy.  Yeah I did. He was very talented. He was just a little                too...  Fat.  He was a fat, starving artist, y'know. That's very rare.                Anyway,   Listen, Jerry can you do me a favour? Could you go into                the room  Well...  What's with him?  Roy!  Oh, my *God*! I hardly recognise you! You look so...  A *lot* of weight.  You look ter*rific*.  This is... uh... you *really* lost weight.  I can't believe it! You were *huge*! Like blubber! I couldn't                Well that's the positive thing about getting sick, you                get to lose   *Get* *out*!  Jerry, did you hear that? He couldn't eat for weeks...  I had no idea I had that kind of effect on you.  Now listen, tell me something. When are you gettin out                of here?  Okay, I'll tell you what. How about on Friday I take you                out for   No that's the week after.  You're wrong.  Shut up...  Uh Roy, this is Kramer-- he's one of our friends.  Prognosis... negative.  He's not doing well, the doctors don't know what it is.                They're   Just my luck, y'know... just when he's getting thin and                attractive.  Mmm...  It's gonna look great in your apartment, George.  I'm so sorry Roy, but actually, we're going to the Poconos                on   We are...  [Catching another glimpse of Roy eating] Please can we                go to   Thank you. Ow!  I just wanted to know what your idea of 'hot' is.  I am ready to skate up a-- ha, ha, ha...Why are you wearing                that?  A fur?  A seemingly infinite supply.  Ow! Careful, it's hot.  He was struttin' around the coffee shop like Stein Erickson.  Eh, anti-fur. I mean, who has the energy anymore? This                is more about hanging off the arm of an idiot.  We never dated in winter.  Oh, I walked by Bloomingdale's the other day, and I saw                that massage chair we want to get Joe Mayo as an apartment gift.  I can't stand Joe Mayo's parties. You know, the second                you walk in, he's got you workin' for him. 'Hey, can you do me a                favor? Can you keep an eye on the  Why?  I'm sorry I can't stay for the... second act.  Hey. I think you know Dr... Zaius.  So, George... did you get the chair?  Hey, Joe Mayo.  Oh, fantastic.  Goodbye, Dr. Zaius.  Good working with you.  What?  Oh. Uhhh...  So Joe Mayo had the same coat.  Mm-hmm.  So now Joe Mayo wants me to buy him a new coat.  No, because I was in charge of the coats. It's... insane.  But he doesn't know that. As far as he knows, somebody                stole it, and that's the person who should be responsible.  So I guess I'll have to buy him a new coat, even though                I don't think I should be held responsible, which I am anyway.  Look at you. You're on a slant.  So, you had to carry some of Keri's stuff. Big deal.  You know what? We sell this thing at Peterman that would                be perfect for you.  No. No. It's a small men's carryall.  It's not a purse. It's European.  Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?  If I'm gettin' him a new fur, I'm not chippin' in on a                gift, too.  Did he get it?  Mmm, good. Tell him I'm out.  Well, I guess I better go and price fur coats.  What are you talking about?  88th Street? That's where Joe Mayo lives. That's the coat!  Come in, come in.  Please, sit down. Newman, um, I wanted to talk to you about                something.  What?  Uh, yeah, uh, no. Newman, uh, I heard that you found a                fur coat in a tree. And, I believe that it belongs to a friend of                mine, and I'd like to give it back to him.  You know, Newmie. Um, I know how you feel about me, and                I have to tell you, I'm quite flattered.  Oh, yeah. I mean, of all the men that I know, you're the                only one who's held down a steady job for several years.  Ha ha ha ha.  Uh, don't worry, he's cool.  Very cool. So, what do you say? Can you do this one little                favor, Newmie?  All right, we're done here.  Thank you, thank you, thank you very much.  Jerry, where'd you get it? That's his coat.  No, that's not your coat.  It's Joe Mayo's coat.  Yeah, he was waitin' inside his apartment for him with                a sock full of pennies.  What is that?  You ditched the fur?  You're gonna wear this all the time?  What do you think of the catalog?  There, we just talked business.  Oh great, put it all on the Peterman account with the other                stuff.   I'll take it.   Why not? [To worker] And some hair for my little friend                here.   ...and I brought I whole new set of cookware, and a water                pic.  Sure, water pic, floss, plax, brush, listerine...  Well, at the latest. Oh hang on a second, I gotta another                call.   Hello?  Oh hey! How are things doing in accounting?  Well, I am the President.  Well, isn't the president allowed to do anything that they                want?  Good day. [Elaine and Roger hang up, leaving Jerry still                on hold]   Well, as you can see the comforter I expensed is actually                the   Well Mr. Ipswitch since everyone of my expenses are obviously                for a   The hat? Why do you need to see the hat?  What?   What do you mean you don't have the hat?  No dead! George, I need that Russian hat back!  Hi, yea, I'm Elaine Benes, we met at Barney's, I'm a friend                of George   I know, he has a real confidence problem.  George...Anyway I know you told him you didn't have the                hat because  Then you wouldn't mind if we took a second look around?  This is an absolute disaster.  You stole her clock?  Well done.   So I told Ipswitch I'd have the hat by this afternoon,                what am I   You look a little stressed.   So Kramer what am I supposed to do? If I don't have that                fur hat by  I thought he was Kramer's friend.   fourty bucks? Are they Sable?  Alright, lets give it a shot, lets go.   Well, that's a kind of sable.   That's a rat hat?  But, but, he's in the Burmese jungle.  Wait? Can I fire you?  Mr. Peterman.   You speak Burmese?  No, you're the only white poet warlord in the neighborhood.  I work for your mail order catalog.   Well, actually I do have a bill here, if you could just                sign this   Its the Urban Sombrero, I put it in the last catalog.   I'm sorry, I got really busy. How long did you wait?  Five minutes? That's it?  I could've! I mean, last week we waited for that friend of Kramer's          for like, forty minutes.  So, the longer you know someone, the shorter you wait for 'em.  When did you tell George to be here?  About five.  Hey! Look who's here! Hey Kurt, this is Jerry, and George, and          Kramer.  No, he just shaves his head. I think it's pretty gutsy.  What? Clinging to some scraps?  Oh, did you guys stop at the bodega today? Some moron bounced          a clown check!  Your hair. It's so thick and lustrous. I mean, it...it was.  Are you saying that I could be dating this hair? With you under          it? <Kurt shrugs.>  Here. <Shows Kurt's driver's licence to Jerry.> Take a          look at that.  No! He's not bald. Look! He's got a full head of hair. <George          overhears and stands up, concerned.>  And he's growing it in just for me. (Happily) It's mine. It's          all mine.  It's not just hair! Look! <Shows Kurt's licence to Jerry again.>  It's chestnut with auburn highlights!  You're not around women. You don't know how important a man's          hair is. <They both look at George, who is reading a newspaper and          struggling to keep his composure.> I'm sorry, George, but it's true.  Oh, it's coming in already! Wow, you have some very nice little          seedlings here. Huh...  Well, it doesn't seem to be coming in so good over here. Or here.  Well, I don't know...how long have you been shaving your head          for?  Huh.  Kurt? What's with the sweats? Aren't we going out?  You, uh...got a big stain on your shirt.  You already ate?  Kurt!  Hey Kurt, slow down! I just can't marry you, whim-bam-boom! I          mean, I need some "fiance-time," I need some "make-my-girlfriends-jealous"          time...  Yeah, yeah, that too.  I don't know...a year?  Could I see the ring again?  Well, it'll be a couple of years before he's completely bald.          Those'll be good times.  Jerry, it's three-thirty in the morning. I'm at a cockfight.          What am I clinging to? <George comes over.>  Stop the fight!  Why did you get into a fist fight with the cop? You were innocent!  So, how long are you gonna be in here for?  So, 10 to 14 months.  Hey.   (Full of pride) My new salesman boyfriend took me out to                celebrate his promotion.   (Obviously embarrassed) Uh, to a restaurant.   I had the roast beef..   (Interrupting) David, can you tell me where the Xerox machine                is?   Oh. (Leaves for the room)   Hey. Wheres Puddy? The copy machine is broken.   (Squints, imitating Puddy) The squinting?   (Stares ahead, again, imitating Puddy) The staring?   I thought all guys do that.   Is that bad?   (Pointing out) Isnt that from your act, like, ten                years ago?   Um, David, you know what? Can you come help me fix the                copy machine?   David, um, I..   Youre a salesman now - and the high-five is.. its                very grease monkey.   Im sorry, but the high-five is just so stupid.   Well, that is really mature.   Huh?   (Confused at Davids attempts at a comeback) Uh..                that doesnt make any sense. I am leaving.   Fine! Were through!   (While leaving) Thats right. (Mocking Puddy, she                puts her hand up) High-five! (Turns around, putting her hand behind                her back like he had done) On the  Hello?   (Jokingly mimicking Jerry) Who is this?   What?!   (Sarcastic) You know, just that you cared enough to call                means so much, Jerry.   Oh, I dont know..   Well, will you pay my cab fare out there?   And I didnt like that roast beef, so how bout                some lunch?   Ill hang the phone up right now!   Ill see ya. (Hanging up the phone)   Cab receipt. Hey, Puddy.   Uh..   (Raising her finger at him, in an authoritative tone) David..                I guess.   What was that?   (While looking over the contract Jerry just drew up) Yeah,                well, thats not bad.   This is nice. What kind of car is this?   (To Jerry) You couldnt just give him one high-five?                So, George, I still dont understand - how was that                a setup?   Very near.   We started to talk, and I told him that I jog, and then                he put his   Jerry, the man is a doctor.  Its the same thing.  Really?  What?  Whats that?  Why?  Latvian Orthodox? Mmm, it is lobster.  Mmm, delicious.  Why dont you just ask her parents?  I think it would be romantic.  Yeah, its like Edward the Eighth abdicating the throne                and marrying   George I was just kidding around.  George I wasnt serious.  I guess this one is my fault.  I dont know.  So what did you say?  What were you doing opening her medicine cabinet?  You were snooping.  Well I trust people not to do that.  What? Now hes a doctor? Before he was a podiatrist.  I am not going to ask him about funguses.  You sure you dont mind?  Well the question isnt even for me its for                a friend.  Well podiatrist.  No no, Im just saying you didnt really go to                medical school, you   I like feet too. Im just saying  No.  You *took* her medicine.  I dont know. We got into this whole thing about how                podiatrists   Its you fault. You just got me thinking.  Ive got nothing against the foot. Im pro-foot.  Do you think I should call him and apologize?  *kiss, kiss* Because I love the foot. Im a big fan                of the foot.  And that pinkie toe, come on . How adorable is the pinkie                toe.  Lets face it, you get a bunion, where are you going?                Youre not   Ill be right back.  Its right down here to the left. I will meet you                right back here.  Well, it's the second row. It's just as good.  Would you shut up? These are great! You can't get any better                than  I could've been at my boss' son's bris right now.  (shrugs) Yeah. (beat) What makes you think anyone would                want to  Anyway, I called him back... I told him I had to go visit                my father  Hi!  Great, great.  (thinking he's joking) Yeah. I better!  You're not serious.  Well, did he say that?  Well maybe you should ask him!  No! I don't have to take it off, why should I take it off?                This  George, we are at a baseball game! This is America!  Well, I don't care, I'm not taking it off.  No!  (sarcastically, to George) Stay!  ...and then the ball hits him in the head and he falls                right over  Well, yeah, he's fine! We took him to the emergency room,                and you  I know! Can you imagine that?  Wha- a picture?  OUR PICTURE'S IN THERE??  (gasps) I cannot believe this!  Ohmygod! Lippman could see this! He thinks I was visiting                my father!  Hi, Mr. Lippman.  My, my father?  Yeah.  I went to visit him.  Well, you name it, uh, neuritis, uh, neuralgia...  Um, yup. Yes, yes, it just... such a miracle, um. My visit                must have  What--what did I say?  I did?  Oh! Where are you going?  Ah. ...Yeah.  There's nothing to read, it's just yesterday's news. You                know, the  Wha-- oh! (noticing her hand) Oh, god! (laughs) That is                the THIRD  Okay! Well, you know, have a nice trip, and uh... alrighty!                (beat)  (on intercom) It's Elaine.  (to Nina) Hello!  (sarcastic) Chatty gal. (beat) Lippman's coming back tomorrow,                I'll  No, he wants to torture me.   (annoyed) Oh! Would you gimme the clicker? I hate it when                you're the  You're all over the dial! You don't know what you want!                I've never  No, come on! I want it, Jerry!  Well at least let George do it!  It's Chapter 2, it's Neil Simon.  What letter?  You know, it's not really that terrible.   Um, oh, it's Townscend, which is NEAR Baltimore.  Well, uh, fan. My father--  Really?  So... impudent.  (pause) Ah. I've-I've got plans, though, Mr. Li--  (very reluctant) Okay.  That will be fun.  Hey.  Where's Jerry?  No. No no. Actually I kind of need to speak to you.  Kramer, ahem, remember that whole deal with you selling                Peterman your stories for his book and then he gave them back to                you?  Well I was kind of, hehehe, short on material and I, um,                I put them in the book anyway.  Kramer listen, it is such a stupid book. It doesn't matter.  He's doing a book signing at Waldenbooks this afternoon.  Mr. Lippman, how are you?  What are you doing here?  Oh.  That was me. I'm sorry. I don't like the stumps.  Oh yeah. It's the best part. It's crunchy, it's explosive,                it's where the muffin breaks free of the pan and sort of (makes                hand motions) does it's own thing. I'll tell you. That's a million                dollor idea right there. Just sell the tops.  "Top of the Muffin to you!"?  Mr Lippman?  This was my idea you stole my idea.  Well if that air is comming out of this face then it is                my air and my idea.  Peach.  So? What do you want me to do about it?  Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you at Pendent Publishing,                I believed in you, you know as a man of integrity. But, I saw you                in that paper hat and that aprin...  Deal. Here's your problem. You're making just the muffin                tops. You've gotta make the *whole* muffin. Then you... Pop the                top, toss the stump. Taste.  Yeah.  I don't know, give em to a soup kitchen.  And one more thing, you really think we need the exclamation                point? Because, it's not "Top of the Muffin *TO YOU!!!*"  Wow. Look at this. We're cleaning up.  Oh, hi.  You been enjoying them?  Well they're perfectly edible.  If the homeless don't like them the homeless don't have                to eat them.  Fine.  We were just trying to help.  I think I might.  Ooh, I've got stump troubles. The Sanitation Department                won't get rid of them all, I can't get a truck to haul this stuff                until next week. Meanwhile, I'm sitting on a mountain of stumps.  Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute, bus? You've got a bus?  You got any room on that thing?  Do you think you could transport some stumps for me? I'll                make it worth your while.  No they don't.  They call him a Cleaner. He makes problems go away.  In the back.  No, no This is all wrong. Where's the Chicken Cashew?  I didn't order any of this. I'm not paying for this.  What list?  MERRY CHRISTMAS TO YOU! Well, I guess we'll just go out.  Ned must have left it here.  HE reads everything, you know, Ned's very well read.  Communist? Don't you think he probably would have told   Yes, . . . yes he does dress a little drab.  and GEORGE: Hey.  Where's Lois?  Who's he?  Uh uh  What's that?  Oh, of course.  No.  Really?  Well what happened when you raced him again?  So now Duncan is back?   So how was work? Another day, another dollar?  Oh well nothing wrong with that. Gotta make those big bucks.          . . . money money money money money money money . . . ha ha ha ha ah .          . . are you a communist?  OH, AH! OH! WOW! WHOA! A COMMIE! Wow, gee, man it must be a bummer          for you guys what with the fall of the soviet empire and everything .  Yeah, but come on . . .   Well, you had a good run, what was it 75, 80 years? Wreaking          havoc, making everybody nervous.   Well, so enjoy yourself. (clink glasses) ha ha uh ha  Well, I'm dating a communist.  Yeah, that's pretty cool isn't it?  Yours or hers?  Oh, congratulations  Ilene.  Hello.  Yeah, yeah. Oh, this is Ned. He's a communist.  Yep . . . a big communist, a big big communist.  Bye bye  Hey, listen while we're here why don't we do a little shirt shopping?          Um. Kramer!  Hi, oh hi Mickey, this is Ned  You guys stay here, I'll be right back.  . . . shut up! (?)  Just because you're a communist, does that mean you can't wear          anything nice? You look like Trotsky. It's gorgeous. Fine, you want to          be a Communist, be a Communist. Can't you at least look like a successful          Communist?   I'm going to order Chinese Food.  Ugh, does it have to be Hop Sing's. I kind of had a fight with          him.  You're father was blacklisted?   Okay, okay. (phones) Um, yeah, hi, I'd like delivery please to          16 West 75th St. apartment 2G.  No. no, she doesn't live here anymore. This is someone else.          Why do you need the name? You already have the address.   Okay, okay, Ned Isakoff.  How do you feel?  Where's Karen?  She didn't ask me what I wanted.   How could she forget I've been ordering lunch every day                here for 3 and a half years?   Ah, you don't know anything. You see, "I don't know                anything", means there's   Oh, hi Mr. Lippman.  Um, uh, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at                that , um, biography of   It's freezing. ... Hurts your teeth.  I'm tellin' ya' somethin' is goin' on. He never likes anything                I recommend.   What do you know. You've never worked in an office. <TURNS                TO GEORGE> See,   What did he do?  Come on tell me what happened.  Why do they call it a wedgie?  Boys are sick.  We just tease some one 'til they develop an eating disorder.  Lippman want's to see me in his office SEE ME! That can't                be good   Maybe I'm getting' a wedgie.  What?  George is on his way up.  Are you OK? What? What?  Remember that biography I recommended? MY BOSS HATED IT  Remember that Columbus book?   Him? Him who?  Hayman The gym teacher? You found him?  At least it wasn't atomic.  Oh? So, I took your suggestion and I gave my boss Marion's                poems.   No, ... he didn't! No, ... he didn't!  Oh, I was just at this recital and Jerry put a Pez dispenser                on my leg and I   We did. We're just hanging out.   Oh, uh, thank you. Are you still friends with Richie Appel?                Have you thought about an intervention?  You get all his friends in a room, They confront himm to                try to get  He's good.   Anyway ... So John told me that Richie is in town from  Yeah, but he want's you to be a part of it.  'Cause Richie really respects you and he would listen to                you.  All right.  Yeah, I was really moved, *really* moved.  Well, I'm sure it wasn't *at* you.  Maybe some mental defective put something stupid on her                leg.  I'm sure she would apologize if she could. Probably somebody                is holding her back against every fibre in her being.  Yeah  What? How?  So? What happened?   Shut up!   Whar about Kramer?  (very uninterested) Uh, you have to work like that?   What's the order?  Albano is your last name.  Hide!  Look, I don't think this is appropriate right now.  You're getting warm.  Oh, hi Noel  (Chuckles)  (laughs)  No, no. It was an accident. It really wasn't my fault.                It was Jerry.  "Coccoon II: The Return". I guess they didn't                like it up there...  Okay, what're we doing here? I have seen *everything*.  Oh, lovely...  What do you think their parents think?  Y'know what? This would be a really funny gift for Pamela's                Yeah, you met her when we were going out.  You have *no* idea who I'm talking about, do you?  Blonde hair remember? Glasses? [pause] Have you *totally*                blocked  Right! In fact... No, never mind...  Well, a bunch of people are getting together tomorrow night                at some  What little deal?

You could have.  It is not necessary.  Sssshhhhhh!!!  Hi Pamela, you remember Jerry.  Oh, Jerry!  I had this dream last night and you were in it.  You were you, but, you weren't you...  I think, I think we were in my house where I grew up, and                you were   You turned around and you had these wooden teeth...  Jerry? Are you listening to me?  Y'know, uh, you could use a little work on your manners.  Well, I just don't appreciate these little "courtesy                responses",   No! You couldn't wait to get back to your little... "conversation".  Uh-huh...  No! No! *You* had wooden teeth! *You* had wooden teeth!                *I*   So nothing... Nothing...  Oh, how do you do. Elaine Benes.  Oh no, let's do it now.  Okay...

It's great to... talk about... other people...  Yeah.  No. A general guy.  What? No, it's not a big deal.  No, we just met...  I don't think so...  Wall street.  And he happens to be pretty good lookin'  And... he's *hilarious*.  I "staked" out his health club.  Well              it's all taken care of. I filed a report. An investigation is underway.  No.              I don't think I should go. I really don't wanna bump into Russell.              He called me the other day. He won't quit.  Jerry,              this is not a crush. This is a complete fixation. he makes me very              uncomfortable.  (to              Kramer) Hey are you gonna go?  Oh,              right.  See,              now this is exciting! This is exciting! Did I miss anything already?  Nah,              now it's on TV. It's different. I told everybody I know to watch it.  No.  Congratulations.  Hey,              what's this? Look.

I'm not              just saying that cause I know you. Honestly.  That              was so good.  You              know what I think this thing is gonna get picked up George. You guys              are gonna be rich!  Oh yeah.  What--              What are you looking at me for?  What              did I do?  I didn't              know that he'd fall for me and I'd drive him insane. I mean, you know,              that's not my fault.  I can't              believe this? What happened to him? Where the hell is he?  Nothing              has changed. How did this happen? (she sees the two guys of the Equal              Employment Opportunity Commission at a table) Ah, these are the two              guys I talked to at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Hey!              What are you two guys doing here? I thought you were gonna do something              about this. Now you're eating here?  (to              Paul) You're checking it out?  (to              the manager) Hey! Come here a second. I want you to know something.              You are not gonna get away with this!  Ah,              "with what?" You know what. With the waitresses. How they're all...              alike.  (embarrassed,              but smiling) Oh, your daughters.  Hi Peggy.

Dr.                Strugatz  Obviously, Mr. Peterman, there's something wrong with this                test. I  Oh, thank you Mr. Peterman.

Oh, I'm                dead. I'm  It's a long story.  What are you gonna do in there?  You gotta do me a favor.  Hold on a second. Mrs. Seinfeld, I need your sample.  I need a clean urine sample from a woman.  Oh please, Mrs. Seinfeld, please?  Well, one of those glasses.  Yeah, he won't mind. C'mon, you're his mom.  Yeah, a coffee cup's fine.

No. Let me see that.                (Takes the paper from Jerry) Don't-mess-with-Johnny."  (Joking) Did you mess                with Johnny, Jerry?  Hey, where's Kramer?  I think what he's trying                to say is that he's having a heart attack.  George!  Jerry!  Hi, George. How ya feeling?                Is anybody getting your apartment?  (Jokingly hits the doctor)                Whose tonsils grow back? (Laughs)  I still have my tonsils.                Everyone in my family has their tonsils. In fact, we were forbidden                to socialize with anyone who didn't have their tonsils.  (Flustered) Oh, I'm sorry.                (Doctor exits) I just.. have to ask that doctor one more question.                (Leaves)  Uh-huh.  Can you let go of my                tongue now?  Let go of my tongue!  Well, I should get going..                (The Doctor leans in for a kiss. Elaine stops him) What are you                doing?  A kiss? With the tongue?                The glossa with the bumps and the papillae? ..Yech, I don't think                so. (Leaves)  Oh, poor George. Oh,                I'm sorry, but I can't stay long. I don't want to run into Doctor                Tongue.. Here, I brought you something. (Takes out a pint of ice  No, not at all...  Oh, could you please hurry?  What? What have I become?

Yeah? What else?  [delightedly] Oh! You "pillage and plunder"?  See? Finally, *finally* I get to meet a man who pillages                and   Y'know I can think of at *least* six known offensive odours                that   I don't mind skunk.  I *loooove* horse manure.  Absolutely.  Listen, lemme ask you something. When you're with a guy,                and he   Wow...  Yeah, last night. Oh, come on... Men *have* to get up early                some  Jerry! I'm *sure* I've seen men on the street early in                the morning.  Is it possible I'm not as attractive as I think I am?  So?  If it attached itself to you, then... Oh, my God! That's                why Carl  Oh, man, just *rampant*, **mutant** B.O. The "O"                went from the   What?  No, no, no! It *can't* be!

Dump her.     He could be eating a Hero, he wouldn't offer me anything. It's          a sickness.   I got a pebble.   What the hell does that mean?   What? Why?   Like...   What's me?   Get out!   I'm going down there.     It looks exactly like me.   What's going on here? How do you think this happened?   You think that could be a coincidence George? Is that possible?            I'm sorry. You can't tell me where the mannequin came from?     Isn't it obvious? This mannequin looks exactly like me.     What are you saying, that I'm not good enough for this hideous          dress?   So, I found out who supplies the mannequins and I called 'em          up.   I don't know. They wouldn't tell me.   We certainly have.   No way!   No.   Kramer, forget it.   I thought George was meeting us here?   He's guarding a suit?   So I made a little list of people who might've made the mannequin.          You know, possible suspects.   There's this blind guy at a party I was at, and he felt my face          for a really long time. You know, to see what I looked like. He almost          put his finger up my nose.   OK, I'm not gonna tell you the rest of the list.   Because you have an attitude.   Yeah, like a swoosh.   It must be the fabric. It's rubbing between you thighs when you          walk. That's what's making that swooshy sound.   Hmm... No you don't.   The mannequin!   You think you can pose me however you want? That's my ass in          your window!   No! You take down that mannequin right now, or I'm pressing charges.            Uh-huh   Uh-huh. Are you taking this down?   Jerry get the car.   Just get the car!   Where are you going?   You guys are not gonna believe this. I just got a letter from          a friend of mine in Chicago who's shopping, and she said she saw a mannequin          that looked just like me. What if there're more. Where are they coming          from?   Why did they hire you for a rodeo?  Didn't he throw you off a bus in the middle of Alabama                or--  You know, Kenny Rogers has a-  Where did you get her?  Come on, Jerry. You didn't notice?  Oh.  Uh-huh. News woman. Yeah.  Downtown New York?  What? What is that?  I was a 718 when I first moved here. I cried every night.  At work?  I don't have a fax machine.  Then maybe you have a fax machine.  Hello?  What?  Aah!  All right! You're foolin' around with your maid. That is                a wise decision.  You are paying a woman to come to your house and sleep                with you.  What? A health plan?  Oh-ho-ho. Oh.  So you consider this a relationship?  Oh. Have you been out?  Where did you go?  Mm! To get what?  Cleaning supplies?  Oh. Well, there's nothin' more sophisticated than diddlin'                the maid and then chewin' some gum.  Hey, Kramer, what was it you were having faxed to my house                every 30 seconds?  Which ones?  So this is never gonna stop?  You can pick 'em up right now.  Ahem. 646? What is this?  I thought 646 was just for new numbers.  No, no, no, no. It's not a new number. It's--it's--it's                just a changed number. See? It's not different. It's the same, just...changed.  You know, I could've killed you, and no one would've known.  No, I'm not. Here you go.  It's a new area code.  No, no. It's right here in the city. It's the same as 212.                They just multiplied it by 3, and then they added one to the middle                number. It's the same.  Yeah? Well, so am I!  Oh, I'm so sorry.  A quick question-- did she by any chance have a 212 phone                number?  Hey.  I hate the counter.  No. She died.  What did he say?  Oh, hi.  What?  Yes! 212.  Hey, what happened to the guy I had last time?  All right! I am back in the game.  Hello?  No. You got the wrong number, kid.  Oh...nuts.   No. It's just that I've been kind of buried over here.  Hit. No. I guess his parents didn't want to tell him. B-2?  He called 6 times yesterday. What a nightmare it must be                to have a real family.  Hit. Uhh...you sank my submarine.  Bobby, you gotta stop calling your Gammy. Why? Because                sometimes you call very early in the morning when Gammy has been                out late the night before and sometimes when Gammy's not alone.                Your parents still haven't said anything to you about your Gammy?                (sighs) All right, here we go. (coughing) Gammy doesn't feel so                good. I think  Aah!  I know. I need a lesson.  Oh. My ballet tickets.  Hey, have you ever been to the ballet?  You know, I'm going as a beard.  Yeah. This friend of a friend knows this banker guy, he's,                I don't know, 30 years, unbelievably  So anyway his boss has a box at the Met and he invited                us to see Swan Lake, which is fine, but he's  Swan Lake, at the Met.  Hey, is George still wearing that toupee?  Doesn't he know how ridiculous he looks in that thing?  Oh, come on.  You look ridiculous in that thing.  Well I think they might have sutured that thing to your                brain.  Well by now, you think people would be a little more open                minded.  Yes indeed.  Really. Why?  Well believe me this didn't happen overnight. Robert's                not exactly a *one* *woman* *man*, if   Oh, hi honey.  Oh it was such a great night.  No, I was a fantastic beard. I held hands, I called him                honey.  Oh it was such a great night. Oh.  Oh I did?  Oh.  He's incredible.  Yeah, I know.  What?  Well it did occur to me.  Why? Is it irrevocable?  We've got a good team.  Why can't he play for us?  We just got along *so* great.  No, no, no, I sensed something. I did sense something.                I perceived a possibility Jerry.  I realize that.  Yes I am.  Melrose Place?  I just didn't know you watched that.  I mean every time I mention it you never say anything or                join in the conversation.  You mean this whole time we could have been discussing                Sydney and Michael and Jane...  Why? Why were you so embarrassed?  That is *so* stupid. Why don't you just confess?  So what are you going to do?  Oh, who do you think you are? Castanza?  Oh god this tastes terrible.  No.  No. I'm sick of shaking. You've got to shake everything.  So, I'm going out tonight with Robert and the boss and                his wife.  Yeah, I think I might.  What do you mean bald?  Oh come on.  Well maybe she got a haircut or something.  Yeah, I've heard of that. I mean they usually wear a wig.  Do you see the irony here? You're rejecting somebody because                they're bald.  (puts her hands up to her mouth) You're bald!  (shouting) I don't like this thing. And here's what I'm                doing with it.  Well I figured that's what couples do.  Well it was easy. Really.  Oh, uh, wait a second. Would you like to come, upstairs?  Yeah. Upstairs?  I was hoping you know, that you might be interested in...                changing teams?  Have you ever thought about it?  Robert, we need a shortstop. *Real bad*.  Hey, I did it.  I turned him. He defected.  Because I'm a *woman*. (swiveling her hips) Ba-ba-ba-boom-chicka-boom-chicka-boom-boom-  Well it's a lesson for the kids out there. Anything's possible.                Jeromy, I have *hit* the jackpot.  He went back.  Well here's the thing. Being a woman, I only really have                access to the, uh... equipment, what,  Yeah, I guess I never really stood a chance.  Yeah. (teary-eyed) Thanks. Is Melrose Place on?  Okay.  Hey George, I am *really* proud of you. I really do admire                what you've done.  What is the matter?  I didn't ruin anything. He looked like an idiot. He did,                and it made him act like a jerk.  Hey, do you believe I got happy new year today? It's February.  It's   It's really cold.  I don't know. What's your definition of scary cold?  Huh, What is that, ha?  You can't even turn around in that thing.  Hey George, can you feel this? [they are hitting his jacket]  Maybe we should stop off on the way and get a bottle of wine          or something.  These people invited us for dinner. We have to bring something.  Yeah.  You can't bring Pepsi.  Because we're adults?  Get off of me. Get off of ME!  I was just thinking. The four of us can't show up with just one          bottle of wine.  We'll get some cake. Can you stop off at the bakery?  Ring Dings?  George, we can't show up at someone's house with Ring Dings and          Pepsi.  Oh, wait a minute. There's the bakery. Stop here. Stop here.          Okay, let me out. You, whatever your name is  Yeah, Jerry, come with me.  Yeah.  Ummm, I love the smell of bakeries.  You know I often wonder what you'll be like when you're senile.  Yeah. I think it will be a very smooth transition for you.  CHOCOLATE BOBKA! That's their specialty.  Yeah, yeah!  Why?  You think it's effeminate?   Oh, we forgot to pick a number.  You think I should go ask her for hers?  No, no it's not fair. Just because they have a ticket doesn't          mean they were here first. We were here and we were ahead of them, and          them, and her. Come on let's just go ask them. Come on. . . . Excuse me.  But we were here ahead of you.  Oh, yeah, right, that's something I do all the time, right. I          make up stories to get ahead in line at bakeries.  Wait, wait a second are, are you Barbara Benedict?  Oh my god. I, I know you. Um, I'm Elaine Benes, you remember          we met at Linda van Grak's baby shower.  Me too.  Well,, this is a little awkward, isn't it?  You know we were here ahead of you.  Oh, oh, fine, go ahead. But listen let me tell you something    /JERRY: See you later.  I know. They're going in first with the last Bobka.  You can't beat a Bobka.  They're going to be heroes.   Well how about a carrot cake?  Black Forrest?   Napoleon? Who's he to have a cake? He was a ruthless war monger.          Might as well get Mengle.   What's this one?  No, but they got the chocolate. We'll be going in with a lesser          Bobka.  I'll have the cinnamon Bobka.   Your views on race relations are fascinating. You really should          do an op-ed piece for the Times.   What is this?   It's a hair.  No, we've already got this. I'll just take it off.  Excuse me.  No noo no, we just bought this. . . . Um, you sold us a cake          with a hair on it.   We waited fifteen minutes for this. Oh. YOU SOLD ME A CAKE WITH          A HAIR ON IT. Then you want me to wait? . . . What are you doing (to Jerry          taking a number) are you going to wait here?  It was a little hair. I took it off.  What if it's your hair?  What is wrong with my hair? Nothing. Nobody takes better care          of their hair than me. You can serve dinner on my head.  Okay, fine, we'll just wait until she calls the number.  No I'm bringing cake!  Why couldn't we have just taken the hair off and go?  Why?  What happened?  You can't tell me?  You found a hair in your Farina?  What happened?  Wow. Who's hair was it?  That's us.  You sold us a hair with a cake around it. I'd like another one.  Ah,  Um, okay, we got the cake now. Where are George and Kramer?  Wait until I get my hands on that George. I'm going to pull that          big hood over his little head, tie the string and suffocate him. You remember          that Panama hat? That was nothing.  What's the matter with you?  What's wrong?  The black and white?  Not getting along?  Well if we can't look to the cookie where can we look?  Hey, what about your vomit streak?  Oh, oh!  Sorry? You almost took my toe off. Why don't you watch what you're          doing you, LUNATIC! uh, I think he broke my toe. [Jerry gets up]          Where're you going?  How was it?  Somebody put a cane on my foot. Just like the one I'm going to          put up your .  Cinnamon Bobka.  Here, here's your cake.  See ya'.  (to the phone)Well did he bring it up in the meeting?  I'm on the phone here.  No thanks. (to the phone)Yeah, Yeah I'll hold.  Why don't you just let Golden Boy soak in the sink with                some   (to the phone)Yeah. Oh! What? He is! Oh! this is so fantastic!                I'm  Yeah! Pendant's publishing his new book, and I'm working                on it!   Oh! Don't you know what this means, it's like working with                Tolstoy!  Ha ha.  But it's a line from that song!  Really?  What, is this your mail? (She takes the mail and starts                flipping  Oh! Your Alumni Magazine.  (She looks closer at the mag.) Hey Jerry, you're in the                Alumni   All right.. this is too fun I gotta get back to work.  Wow!  Oh! I can't believe this, Kramer!

GoldenBoy?  I'm sorry.  I once broke up with a guy because he didn't keep his bathroom                clean   Oh yeah, I told him all the time. You would not have believed                his   Hi.

All she'll think is that you like her.  I don't know what your parents did to you.  It is funny.  Oh, see, this is the problem.  Don't forget.  Y'know, my brother-in-law once left a message on this guy's                machine,   Yeah.  Well it's only been three days, I'm sure he's gonna call.  If only.  Hey, when you walk him, do ya...  Do you pick it up?  You pick it up?!?  Oh, boy would I love to see that.  Maybe you should call the airline, they might know where he is.  No, milk.  What is a bender anyhow?  I can't believe he hasn't called.  We're going to the movies, we're gonna see Prognosis Negative.  Kramer, I don't know how you lasted as long as you did.  If you could see her personality it would be like one of the Elephant  Are we still going to the movies tonight?  Just me and George?  But we need you.  Because... Yeah?  Because I relate to George through you, we're like friends-in-law.   Just me and George alone?  Do you?  It's up to you.  Well, it's, I really wanted to see Prognosis Negative with Jerry, uh,  Oh! I tell you what. How about if I come back here first and I clean  I know, it's not that.  About three years.  Hmm.  Yeah. An uncomfortable silence ensues. They both speak at the same  Yeah. So I've been here about six years.  Jerry likes Morning Thunder.  Yeah.  Jerry doesn't know Morning Thunder has caffeine in it.  No.  I know!  It was weird because George and I get along so great in so many  The only time it wasn't uncomfortable was when we were making fun of  Do you have to?  You know, the guy might have just lost your number.  Jerry, do you know what they do to dogs at the pound? They keep them  What is it?  Terrific.  Yes, she understands you and she is not demanding.  Oh, Kramer, we didn't mean it.  Kramer, we like her.  I believe I referred to her personality as a potential science exhibit.  Jerry, can't you just give it one more day, it's not his fault.  Alright, I tell you what. How about if you and George go to the  We'll see it Sunday.  I'm not going, I'm gonna watch the dog.  Well, you know, I mean, sometimes it's good to get there and make sure  Yeah.  Who's stopping you?  Like we care if you go to the bathroom.  Good. Good. You?  Boy, he takes such a long time.  You know what he does in there? He gargles.  Yeah, he does it like six times a day.  Because he does it quiet. He does it quiet. Lookit, Just like this,  We talked about that already.  Gimme the jacket, furface, this is not Seinfeld you're dealing with!   Shut up. Shut up! (Answers phone) Hello? No, who's calling? Oh my  We made plans.  I thought you wanted to see Prognosis Negative.  Jerry, you promised me we'd go.  Wait, George saw the movie? I saw him yesterday, he didn't mention it.  Yeah, I wanted to talk about how we have nothing to talk about.  I thought she was the one.  Okay, c'mon it's movie time.  I'm really sorry George, I, I, I wasn't jealous of you.                It was just the   I don't know where the rabbi got that. Ya know I never                said that. I said  What kind of shopping?  Where are you going?  Oh that's a nice store.  Nothing.

Did you know that Mozart died                while he was  Really?  Yeah, I called him Maestro.  Well, I did at first, but actually I kind of got used to                it.  I am not calling you "Jerry the Great".  He is a Maestro.  So you say.  Yeah. (bragging) I'm invited.  Why?  Yeah, well maybe there aren't any houses to rent there.  Hey. Hi Maestro.  Yeah.  It's BOOKED Jerry!  (Passionately) Oh Bob! Bob!  (Correcting herself) Maestro!  It's been a rough couple of weeks, ya know I really needed                to get away.  You're right Maestro.  [claps her hands] That is the single greatest packing  [laughs] Yeah, right, you're the master packer.  'Scuse me...master packer!  Just gimme your keys.

I don't know, who to rune for, George's place has  I'd better not...  So what did he say?  I can't believe I lost the deposit on that u-hall. [I  My roommate starts rehearsal tonight on Carrousel.  Couldn't be happier. [idem]  You are kidding me. How am I supposed to get to this meeting?  Oh forget it, I hate those. Everytime I take one, the driver                will *not* stop talking to me. No matter how disinterested I seem                he just keeps yakking away. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Why does everything                always have to have a social componant? Now a stage coach, that                would have been a good situation for me. Cause I'm in the coach,                and the driver is way up there on the stage.   I guess that could work.  Pardon me?  Yeah.  You know I'm having a lot of trouble, um, hearing you back                here. So...  I'm going to have to be honest with you. I'm going deaf.  What?  It can be very frustrating.  An I fearing AIDS? Oh, yeah sure, who isn't. But you know                you gotta live your life.  Tom Hanks? After me you're picking up Tom Hanks? I love                him.  Yeah. Yes it does...  No no, no no.  Hey.  What is this about?  You are kidding. That is amazing. (She pushes Jerry, Jerry                falls back into Kramer.) I just took a car service from work and                to get the driver to not talk to me, I pretended I was going deaf.  Oh didn't work. He caught me hearing. I know it's terrible,                but I'm not a terrible person.  No. When I shoo squirrels away, I always say "get                out of here". I never ever throw things at them and try to                injure them like other people.   Yeah, and when I see freaks in the street I never, ever                stare at them. Yet, I'm careful not to look away, you know, because                I want to make the freaks feel comfortable.  Yeah, and I don't poof up my hair when I got to a movie                so people behind me can see. I've got to make it up to this guy                or I won't be able to live with myself. What can I do?  Oh, thanks Kramer.  Yeah I think he's right. I've never seen a ball man.  Hey you know a friend of mine from work said that she saw                George at the tennis match on TV yesterday.  I heard you *really* inhaled that thing. Did anyone tape                it?  Oh come on. If she's that superficial you don't want her.  So I guess you're not going to Todd's party on Friday.  I beg to differ.  He's the *loser*. She's the victor. To the victor belong                the spoils.  Well we can take the car service from my office.  Yeah, they don't know.  She's so wild. Can I borrow her for a few hours tomorrow                afternoon?  It's so amazing getting to see Monica Sellas playing in                the finals.  Why do you keep watching?   And then you flush.   You know, sometimes people won't go in to a place, if they don't          see anyone else in there.   You have to do that? Jerry, don't do that, that is so annoying.          It's your house.   Casus belli.   It's Latin. I read it in some book. I don't know, I just wanted          to say it out loud.   Have you gone in there?   Sure, fine.   Casus belli.   Since when do you wear cologne?   What IQ test?   It's just a Latin phrase George, it does not mean anything. Now,          what is this test?   Oh, that sounds like fun.   You'll do well, you're smart.   What did you get on your SAT's?   Mine's 145.   You get out of here!   What?   Are you serious?   Where would I take the test?   No, that would be too noisy.   Hey, what do you think?   Yeah, that's what is is, a caper.   What the hey.   What's been going on in there? I've been standing here for 20          minutes.   All right, what time do you want me back here.   Ok.   All right.   Oh, no no I'll just have a tea and toast.   Um, ok, I'll have the rigatoni.   I know.   Hey.   Yeah, ok...[takes the test and goes to another table.]   Statute.   Look, Kramer, I have to take this test ok, I don't have a long          of time.   An IQ test.   It's for George.   Yeah, can I...can I explain it to you later?   Would you please?!   Later!   Yes, yes!   Babu! If you don't mind?   Oh my God! It's all over the test!   Oh man! Look at this...and I'm late anyway.   It was an accident.   Babu Bhatt did it.   You're very special.   Just give it back to him.   85?   He's coming up?   Yeah, but an 85, that's ridiculous.   George, I cannot believe...   No there has got be a mistake.   There were too many distractions there. Babu...what ever he's          name was and Kramer...I couldn't concentrate.   Jerry! It was! Let me take it again.   Oh, come on, come on. I guarantee 140. What do you have to lose?          No, no, I guarantee it.   Ok, now where I'm going to take it.   What are you doing?   What's going on?   Why did you come in here for?   Well Kramer, I have to return this test. I've got to get out          of here.   I had to take it again.   What's the difference?!!   What?   Well eh, kind of....   Oh.   Oh, this...emm...yeah...here you go.   Actually, you know what, I think I did. The first time I couldn't          really cons...[Monica closes the window]...entreat.   Hey guys, I just ran in to Monica. You know what my IQ is? 151.          No, Chinese.   Yeah. What do you do all day?  uh-uh.  Yeah, you do! He looks very busy!  (laughs)  No. I'm completely blocked! In fact, I'm gonna work on                it tonight. Oh. Oh no! Oh, I can't!  You know, this guy Jean-Paul, Jean-Paul... I met him when                I was working at Pendant,  Yeah, that's him.  Yeah, he's Trinidadian and...Tobagan. (laughs)  Ah, I know. I know...!  Yeah, well, he was pretty devastated. This is his first                race in 3 years.  What responsibility? I don't have any responsibility.  Eh...he'll get up...  Hi, Judy.  Fine. (laughs)  Yeah.  (whispering) She's not... and the guy just took off. (makes                a sad face)  I know, it's just something you have to say...  Jerry. Jerry, this is Jean-Paul.  Listen, listen I'm gonna go call work to see if I can get                my deadline extended.  Yeah, that's funny. (annoyed)  Jerry...  I've got an alarm, ok?  It works.  It... works!  Hey. Sorry I'm late.  I got held up. Do you mind if I heat this muffin up?  What? (Elaine puts her muffin in the microwave and sets                the timer) What is the problem?  uh-uh. uh-uh. And this all means uh...what?  Oh are you?!  Hey, I'm not running in the marathon! He is!  Yeah, I got enough to think about just tryin' to come up                with some load o'crap for that  Hey, Jean-Paul.  Oh! (rushing to the microwave) My muffin! (opens microwave                door) Oh, shoot! (slams it)  Oh I don't know. I set this thing for 20 seconds.  (pointing at Jerry) Don't say anything! Don't..say..anything!  (leaning against the refrigerator) Jean-Paul, it's not                my microwave, ok? Ok? All right,  (to Jerry) All right. We'll see you at the race, ok?  Oh that's cute! (closes door and exits with Jean-Paul)  (thinking and typing) It was a cold winter's night in Timbuktu...                Jean-Paul? (searching everywhere) Hey Jean-Paul? Jean-Paul?                (worried) Jean-Paul?!  Jerry, Jerry, Jean-Paul's missing! He's alone in the city!                Call me back. (hangs up)  Judy, hi, listen...  Oh I didn't tell anyone.  ... Jerry! (runs angry to her apartment)  Ohhh, I'm exhausted. I've been on this street a thousand                times! It's never looked so  Then how did she find out, Jerry?!  Oh no, thank you.  There's Jean-Paul! He's up front! He's leading! (jumping)                Go Jean-Paul!(starts screaming)  Go Jean-Paaaaaul!  "Oh! Okay. Right. Thanks Mr Pitt....'kay. ..goodbye."  (to Jerry) "Hey ! You want to go see "The Velvet                Fog".  "Yeah! Mel Torm, That's his nickname."  "Do you wanna go or not?"  "He's performing at this AMCA benefit."  "Able Mentally Challenged Adults"  "What are you..crazy?"  "Well, what am I gonna do for a date.?...Oh! do you                know that   "Yeah yeah! He's really handsome with those..."  "You can't find beauty in a man?"  "He's smart...."  "Penthouse?"  "Hey! Hey! listen ... Do one of you guys know that                ..that blond guy   "You know that just admitting a man is handsome doesn't                necessarily   "All right, I'm gone"  (We hear what she thinks) Look at me....Look at Mee!. Come                on. I'm   "Aaaaaahhh! He is?!"  "AAaaaaahhh! Really?"(giggles)  "Oh! well I'd like, like to get to know him."  "Ha...."  (as she comes in) "What about the Velvet Fog?"  "I'm going to that!"  "What are you talking about?"  "Yeah, yeah! Arnold Deensfrei, he runs the AMCA "  "I know that but why are you going?"  "What you do!!. You don't do anything."  (pointing at the shoes) "What are those?"  "He thinks you're mentally challenged."  "Well ,what happens when you show up . He'll see that                you're not.?"  "....Maybe you were still under the gas.Maybe you                were hallucinating   "your shirt was out?"  "Well, what kind of shirt was it.?"  "Oh! Well ... You don't tuck those in?"  "Well.

"About tonight hum.. there's been a little misunderstanding."  "Yeah. What happened was...."  (suddenly intrigued) "You know, I've never heard anyone                talk the way  "Well anyway hum.... see when I made the date, I thought                that   "Elaine once tried to convert one but Elaine's not                going through   "Yeah!"  "I don't care:"  "Hey Jimmy!!"  "Elaine got a new dress."  (from a distance) Hey.  (to Wendy) Wendy, George. (to George) Wendy.  (warning) George.  Bye Wendy. I'm sorry.  (slapping George on the arm) What did you do that for?  (pinching George's arm) Ask about your arm.  She's a physical therapist. She doesn't want to have to deal          Because, it is what she does.  George, you got a little something, right here.  Why?  Huh, yeah, I know. It's not very flattering.  Oh, I could never say anything to her about that.  Yeah. Hah.  No. If you tell him to do it, he'll never do it.  (sharp intake of breath) Hoh. Yes, yes, you're right. That's          (to Kramer) ...Kramer.  (to Jerry, indicating Kramer) Yeah. This is gonna work out just          Wha... W.. Are you going home?  Uh, could you come back in about five minutes?  No reason. (big smile) Just wanna see you again.  Yeah, she'll be here any second.  Listen, Jerry. She never dates, and I know it's because of her          Well, this is it. Shall I go get Kramer?  What is the big deal about putting your lips on somebody's   How 'bout an intercourse hello? How would that be?  (indicating) That's her. That's her.  Oh, you hear that? That must be Kramer.  Uh, Kramer. Kramer, I'd like you to meet my friend Wendy.  (hopeful) Oh, you were?  Kramer, if she wants to change her hair...  Oh, Kramer.  You wanna go out with him?  Well, it's just that... uh, I don't...  I'm just thinking about the question.  Hey Kramer, my friend Wendy wants to go out with you.  (laughs) Hee, hee, hee. Hee hee hee...  Nothing, nothing. (laughs out loud)  Why?  Oh, yeah, there's nothing better than skiing.  Ugh, the hell with 'em.  What're you stopping here for?  (pointing) Oh, no, I'm three more blocks.  Yeah, but it's only three blocks.  (unbuckling her seatbelt) Alright, well...  She'd driven me a hundred and twenty miles and, all of a   I've never heard of anything like this. I mean, it's almost as          I had to carry my skis, and my boots and my poles. I think I          Yeah, alright, I gotta go.  (surprised) George!  (feeling her arm) Wendy, I injured my shoulder, Wednesday, when          (shocked) Insurance? You're charging me?  Oh, huh huh, that is a good idea. C'mon George.  (pointedly) And you know, you might wanna do something about          Huh, I think it's a little old-fashioned. Don't you? (to   Todd.  No, he's not.  By marriage.  Oh, pardon me for trying to set you up with a beautiful,                intelligent woman.  She stopped performing.  It was an accident!  I don't know what I'm gonna do. She asked me to give her                a baby shower.  anyone else, never. But, Leslie - I have a problem saying                no to. For some reason, I seem to want her approval.  Oh, would you two stop with the Kennedys? Why does everybody                make such a big deal about he Kennedys? What is this fascination?!                Who cares?! It's  (To Jerry) I do have one teeny little problem, though.  See, I was gonna give the shower in my apartment..  My roommate has Lyme disease.  She has this in addition to Epstein-Barr. It's like Epstein-Barr                with a twist of Lyme disease.  I don't know. She did some outdoor version of Hair in Danbury,                Connecticut.  It's a classic.  I guess. She must've rolled over on a tick during the love-in.  What do you wanna know?  Rarely.  No.  Saturday.  I'll take full responsibility. You won't regret it.  So, where's Todd?  Oh my God, Hyannisport? With the Kennedys? Who else is                up there? Is Rose up there?!  Leslie, Leslie, whatever happened to Sargent Shriver? Is                he still with them? You don't hear much about him these days. Is                he out of the loop?  (Whispering to Kramer) What is this?! What are you doing                here?  The cable? No, no, no. I'm having a party here. You can't                do this now!  Who's this guy?  Both of the them.  Okay.. Does Jerry know about this?  You can't! You can't do this now!  Alright. Just do it fast and then get out.  (To Kramer) Kramer, Kramer, look at him. (Gestures to Tabachnick)                Look! He's eating all the food!  Kramer!  What are you doing here? I thought you were out of town                for the weekend.  I can't believe you told Kramer it's okay to put the cable                in during the shower! Jerry, look,, look! They've eaten everything.  (Speaking confidentially to George) George, don't even                think about it! Don't even dream about it!  I'm sorry you have to go.  Oh, Leslie, I am so sorry about everything that went on                here tonight. You know, I had no idea..  (Not sure if it was an insult or a compliment) Oh, thank                you. (Leslie leaves. Then Elaine wonders to herself) "Like                you were in college"?  Why can't I meet a Kennedy? ..I saw John Junior once downtown.                I was on a bus. I hit the ding, but.. it didn't stop.  Yeah, uh, I'm looking for a Rollamech 1000 mechanical pencil.  No, I'm sure you do.  Well, it's for my boss.  Elaine.  It's just Elaine, like Cher. Ha ha ha  Uh, aw, KL5-239O.  Okay, [to Jerry]  Move  along. . .   I think he's got ideas.   Just call me when the new pen comes in, okay?  Hey hey  Hi.  Oh, mine's "Ike".  Ah, no.  No, no. How about if you bring me back something?  Um, hum, I don't know.. . . A big salad?   They have big salads.  They have a big salad.  It's okay, you don't  Maybe I should just get married.  I know. You know, whenever I'm on a date I feel people can tell.  You can say that again.  Good for you.  Right on baby. (???)  Who Gendason?  Oh, how did you end up playing golf with him?  So what?  I still don't see what the big deal is.   I told ya'. He has ideas.  Or you.  Hey.  No problem.  Thank you, Julie.  I like Julie. She's very personable.  That's great George.   Yeah, A big salad. Very good. Actually it was too big. Ha ha          ha Wht?  Even though what?  What? What are you trying to say, George?  You want the money for the big salad, George?  What is the problem?  It must be a mistake.  Perhaps there's more to him than meets the eye.   It's possible.  He's an enigma, a mystery wrapped in a riddle.   Ugh! You are kidding me.   I bought mine yesterday on 14th Street.   To please Mr. Pitt.   Uh, great!  Hi Julie.  Oh, well then I better get going otherwise George will make me          buy him lunch to make up for that big salad he bought me yesterday.   It's just that my boss is very demanding and he needed the pencil          right away.  No, no no I didn't know. I, I'm sorry.   Really? A fight with the foreman?   Well, again, I'm just awfully sorry.   Okay.   Well, ,I'm going out with the stationery store guy.   I felt so guilty about the pencil I couldn't say no.   Well, well, well, I'm not treating you to lunch ANYMORE! You          had to tell Julie that I made a special point of telling you that I bought          you the big salad. Didn't ya'.   Uh, uh.  Hi Mr. Seinfeld! (hug)  (looking by the window) Ooh, you have a lake?  I can't take your bedroom.  I can't kick you out of your bed.  Yeah, I'll just stay in here. (goes in the guest room)  Hi. Nice to meet you.  And scuba diving.  Mmm, nice to meet you.  Here, let me see it. (She takes a pad to try the pen) Hey, it          wrtites upside down.  Come in.  Why is it so hot in here? How can they sleep like this?  Oh man. What is with this bar? It's right in my back. It's killing          me.  I am never gonna fall asleep.  How can they not put the air conditioning on?  This bar is right in my back! It's making a dent.  I'm sweating here. I'm in bed, sweating.  Oh!  My back.  That... That bed. The bar was right in my back.  I don't even know if I can go scuba diving.  You can go.  (whispering to Jerry) Yes!  Mrs Seinfeld, please. I am begging you. Put the air conditioner          on.  I've lost 6 pounds.  (with pain) Hi Evelyn.  The astronauts use them.  Somebody please-- THE AIR CONDITIONER!  No no, I wanna go.  Oh, oh, O.K. (Helen holds her sweater tight against herself)          You can turn down the air conditioning if you want.  You're not too cold?  Having a good time!  My back hurts.  (still on the floor) Uh... What about those muscle relaxers?  Say what? (laughing) Say what?  (still laughing, she says it just as the picture is taking) Astro...naut!  (still with her imitation, shouting even louder) STELLA! STELLA!  (wakes up and yells very loud) STELLA!  Five days? You want me to stay here for five more days?  (discouraged) Five days. Here.  Excuse me?  (to Jerry) Five more days?  Is that tomorrow?  New jeans?  Still a 31 waist?  Lena Small?  Oh, you're not gonna cop a girl's phone number off an AIDS charity          list!  You're a taking person.  What's he look like?  You're buying a speedboat?  I don't know about that.  Well...  Very much.  Haven't been in the lab yet. But I am birth control shopping          today. <Kramer overhears as he returns to the booth.>  Uh, Kramer...  The sponge, o.k.? The Today sponge.  Off the market? The sponge? No, no...no way. Everybody loves          the sponge.  Well, Kramer was right. My friend Kim told me the sponge is off          the market.  I'll tell you what I'm gonna do - I'm gonna do a hard-target          search. Of every drug store, general store, health store and grocery store          in a 25-block radius.  Hey man, women are really loyal to their birth control methods.          What does Susan use?  You don't know?  Sixty?! Uh...well, I'll take three.  Make it ten.  Twenty sponges should be plenty.  Yeah, twenty-five sponges is just fine.  Yeah. Just give me the whole case and I'll be on my way.  O.k. Hold on just a second. <Gets up and heads to the bathroom.          George knocks at the door.>  Yeah. Cleaned out the whole west side. Why?  Ah, Susan uses the sponge.  Yeah, I'm sorry, George. I can't help you out.  I can't do it. No way, there's no how. <Tries to push George          out the door. George resists.>  Oh yeah, I know all about make-up sex, and I'm really sorry.          <Shoves George into the hallway and closes the door. George blocks          the door with his foot.>  I'm   What?  Hey, I didn't even use one.   Yeah, it was, but then I just couldn't decide if he was really          sponge-worthy.  Yeah, Jerry, I have to conserve these sponges.  Yes, yes - before they went off the market. I mean, now I've          got to re-evaluate my whole screening process. I can't afford to waste          any of 'em.  So, you think you're sponge-worthy?  Run down your case for me again...?  You going to do something about your sideburns?  And the bathroom in your apartment?  The sink, the tub, everything got cleaned?  Alright, let's go. <They head for the bedroom.>  Yep.   Nope. <Billy leans in to kiss her.> What are you doing?  Oh...I don't think so.  I wish I could help you, but I can't afford two of 'em. <Pats          Billy on the shoulder and gets out of bed.>  I will.   I don't know. I'll hide 'em. So, is Kramer upset?  Well, maybe you should just give him the keys back.  Oh, I'm not, uh...  Jerry, give him the keys back.  Just 'cause you have his keys? Why does he need yours?  That's ridiculous.  I'll give you back your spare keys - but now I want mine back.  'Cause. I'll give 'em to Jerry.  'Cause he gave me his.  So, if he has my keys, I should have his.   I just said the same thing to you.  What?  Yeah, O.K. I'll go get 'em. <George begins to leaf through          papers on Elaine's counter.> What are you doing? Would you just put          that down? <Takes the papers away from George.> I gotta get some          new friends.  What's going on?  Yeah, yeah, I saw it. <mutters under her breath> I mean,          it's complete bullsh*t.  What...?  Nothing. I didn't say anything.  Yeah, I saw it. I saw it! I did, I saw it. Yep.  I didn't say anything.  You weasels!  How dare you!  Who gave you permission to come into my house and just go through          all my things? You thought it was funny?  You! Get out! Get out! Get out!  Here! Here's your damn keys, you keep 'em! I don't want 'em anymore!  No, you can't be trusted!  Good! I won't!  These aren't my keys!  I don't know!  I just thought I could write it.  I don't know. Those writers make a lot of money.  O.K., can I just watch the show? <mutters under her breath>          God, what an asshole.  I didn't say anything.  Where are they goin'?  (Laughing) That's funny. Hey, listen, what are you doin'                Saturday  I need someone to go with me to Mr. Lippman's son's Bar                Mitzvah.  (Taking out Boggle) Oh, I don't think that's possible.  Congratulations, Mr. Lippman.   Oh, congratulations, Adam. (Adam zealously French-kisses  Yeah.   And I think he's been telling his friends. I got invitations                to six  Where did that come from?   No.   So Adam, I just talked to your father, and, apology  Yeah, I know. Uh, by the way, could you do me a favor and  I am, but that is not the point. You are thirteen, and                I am  No. You are not a man. It takes a *long* time to become                a  (Eating) Walnuts, mmmmmm.   Adam, you don't become a man overnight. Look at your  Well, I'm sorry, sir, I tried.   Uhh. I guess so. Why? (Mr. Lippman vigorously starts  (Coming in Jerry's apartment) Hey. Happy New Year!   Did you and Patty just break up?   Well, then you're free tonight. You know what, I heard  Whoa. What is the matter?   Jerry, you break up with a girl every week.   Oh my God. You're crying.   So now the *other* Lippman kissed me.   What?   I know what it means, but what does being a shiksa have                to  Oh, that's insane.   I am not buying a computer from you.   (Pausing) Even so.   Don't get me wrong, Mr. Lippman. I-I'm very flattered that  If you weren't Jewish, you wouldn't be interested in me.                Oh, no. Don't!   Oy vey!   Well. You are not gonna believe this. Now Lippman is  Oh, no. Jerry, I can't take any more gentle sobbing.   Do you have an apple or anything?   Or a nectarine? I would absolutely love a nectarine.   Why am I in such a fruit mood? Ahh, banana!   What?

Maybe we should get married. Maybe everything we need is  What? What happened to the new Jerry?   Oh, well that's just *great!*   Well, that's because you're an idiot.   I know, I know. I'm sorry I'm late.  I dropped a grape.  I dropped a grape in the kitchen and it disappeared. I                couldn't find it. I was... I was literally on my knees for ten minutes                looking for this stupid grape. I  No, I'm just getting over an allergy attack. This guy I'm                going out with -   Robert. Yes.. thank you. He has two cats and I'm allergic                to them. You know, I finally meet a normal man, and I can't even                go into his apartment, you  Vanessa.  (balancing a spoon on her nose) Hey, why don't you take                her to that place in Vermont I was telling you about? You know,                that really charming place with  You're getting what?  I'd do it but I don't have any money.  Televising opera?  Tuna?  They're dying in the nets.  Jerry, can't you incorporate one unselfish act in your                daily routine?  And I'm going to have an English muffin with margarine                on the side and a cup of coffee.  Thank you. What evidence is there that cats are so smart,                anyway? Huh? What do they do? Because they're clean? I am sorry.                My Uncle Pete showers  I don't know. I can't think of any solution, unless of                course they should meet with some unfortunate accident. What do                you think a hit man would charge to  What do you think, Jerry? You wanna make twenty-eight bucks?  How about we go over there right now and we shave them?  He actually wen to the hospital?  Oh man, he's nuts.  Didn't work, huh?  Well, what are you gonna do about the stock?  I'm kinda full.  No, I just have a cold.  I gave him an ultimatum. (Shrugs)  They're very clean animals.  Almost as bad as losing out to a perfume.  Superman can go back in time?  Do you want some of mine?  (Elaine turns to look at the man, trying to make it sound                like they aren't talking about him) The thing about that painting..                is with the colors and um.. (Turns  (Slightly embarrassed) Yes, a guy.  Seattle.  (To Jerry) You tell him.  Ed.  ..We shared an interpersonal experience. (George hits his                glass with his fork. To Jerry) Go on.  On some people.  It was just gonna be a weekend, but then somehow it became                a week.  (Joking, she snobbishly says) I'm never eating here again.  I said I would never eat here again.. But, I, I.. he had                to know I was kidding.  Oh, I said it in a kidding way.  Was it my fault?  (Through intercom) Yeah.  I don't know if you people are aware of this, but I am                one clever chickadee.  His phone's been disconnected, but I was able to obtain                an address - 1324 Amsterdam Avenue, apartment 4D. (Hands George                a card) Now, I did my  Does the word "charm" mean anything to you?  I would, but I have to pick up Ed at the airport.  Ed's downstairs. CAn I have the car keys?  Got any asprin? (Finds some) Hello. Now, lookit, you guarantee                this car will get me to the airport tomarrow? No problems?  Because if there's even the slightest chance of any problem                at all, I don't want to take it - because if I don't get this guy                on a plane to Seattle and out of my  I heard a little ping in the car last time. What was that                ping?  Jerry, you cannot imagine how much I hate this guy.. and                he hasn't even done anything! It's the situation. He's a wonderful                guy, but I hate his guts!  I've got it all mapped out - I'm taking the tunnel.  I spoke to a cab driver. For five bucks, he turned me on                to the Rockaway Boulevard shortcut.  Now, lookit, this plane leaves at 10:15. We're getting                up at about eight. That gives us enough time, right?  (Trying to wake Ed up) Get up! The alarm clock didn't go                off! (Shakes him) It's 9:15! You're gonna miss the plane! It's 9:15!  Yes! 9:15!  Tomarrow?! Are you crazy? No, now, now! Let's go! (Gets                his suitcase from the closet, throws it on the bed, and frantically                starts packing) You get  Shower?! ARe you out of your mind?!  Forget the shower! The shower's out. Move it! Put your                clothes on! Put your clothes on! (Pulls out drawers of clothes,                turning them over in the suitcase.  The kitchen?!  They're not making it! Let's get your pants on!  No! You have your ticket! You have to go now!  Don't say that!  Shut up and pack!  You're talking too much!  What?!  What? What sweater?  You didn't bring a brown sweater.  Here! Here! You want a brown sweater?! (Recahes into one                of her drawers, and grabs a brown sweater, then packs it) You got                a brown sweater!  It's brown! (Takes clothes still on the hangers, and dumps                them into the suitcase)  NO time for folding.. (Looks around) I think that's it.                (Zips up the suitcase)  Shoes? Shoes?! Shoes?! Shoes weren't invented till the                fourth century! People walked around for thousands of years without                them! (Puts her coat on over  (Slow, as if remember a dream) I never new I could drive                like that. I was going faster than I've ever gone before, and yet,                it all seemed to be happening in  (Into the intercom) Yeah?  He's coming up. (Buzzes him in) He's coming up..  Oh, that was awful. Poor Antonio. (Waiter hands Elaine                two bags of food to go) ..Thanks.  Till when - till he goes back to Seattle, or till he can                feed himself?  Take care of yourselves. (Leaves)  Bah bah baaah, Boo doo bah bah bah, boo doo                waaaah, waah, waaaah...  Hey guess what? This window doesn't work.  Gimme ten bucks and find out...  Yeah, worked out good.  What?  Get out of here! Why?  Yeah...  So what happened?  Hey, how we doin' on time?   Hey! Wait up!  Yeah, you want five?   You're giving him *ten* dollars?  That's a pretty big tip...  They don't get that much.  We can't ask him...  Jerry, we don't have time for this...  What!?  *Five* dollars a bag? I don't think so.  You got some nerve trying to take advantage                of us...  You're lucky I don't report you...  Wait up!  We're not going to sit together?  Well, what about George? He's supposed to                pick us up at Kennedy.  There's no time.  Jerry!  Why should you get the first class?  No.  You flew here coach.  All right, fine. I don't care. If the plane                crashes, everybody in first class is going to die, anyway.  Great... [To herself] Help me...  Oh, look at this... He's sleeping and I have                to go to the bathroom. Maybe he'll wake up soon. What if my kidneys                burst? Is it worth it not to wake this man up to damage a major                organ? I hope this disgusting slob appreciates what I'm doing for                him... [To passenger on the other side of her, but still to herself]                Yeah, make a little more noise with your gum-- that's helpful.  [To herself, loudly] Wake up, you human slug!                Wake up! *Wake*   [To anyone who'll listen] What'd he say? What'd              he say?  Hi. Can I get to my seat?  But you just passed it. I'm sitting right                there next to that guy...  Well, nobody *told* me that!  Excuse me. I'm sorry to make you do this,                  but I got stuck in the aisle and the flight attendant wouldn't let me                get through.   I'll try and remember that. [Pause] Where's                my meal?  Excuse me? Excuse me, but I didn't get a meal.  Yes, I'm sure! I would know if a tray of food                had been served to me.  Kosher meal? I don't want a kosher meal. I                don't even know what a kosher meal is.  Then why didn't you take it?  You're eating my food!  What? Oh, no... nothing for me thanks.  Elaine Benes?  No, but there was nobody sitting here...  Oh, no, please, don't send me back there.                Please, I'll do anything. It's so nice up here. It's so comfortable                up here. I don't want to go back there. Please don't send me                back there... [She notices another attendant offering goods]                Ok, fine. I'll go back... You know, our goal                should be a society *without* *classes*! [She goes through the                curtain to,ick, *coach*] Do you realise that the people up here                are getting *cookies*!  Yeah, *you* got *your* bags...  The worst flight I have been on in my entire                life.  [thinking] I can't believe I'm going out with this guy.                Wow! He's so   Jerry, you have got to come see him. He is so terrific.  Yeah. Right. [laughing] Like that really matters.  Oh, yeah.  Well, actually, he's - he's not that way at all.   Yeah. In fact, he....[moaning]  I don't wanna!  [sighs] Well, actually, he, um, doesn't really like to                do...  Yeah. It's surprising.  No. No, it doesn't bother me. I mean, it would be nice.                I'm not gonna   Exactly.

(To waitress) Oh, nothing for me. (Waitress leaves) I'm                going to "Atomic Sub" later.  I got a card, and they stamp it every time I buy a sub.                24 stamps, and I become a submarine (makes a gesture) captain.  (Embarrassed) Free sub.  What?  What is it? (Grabs the card from George, he tries to stop                her, but fails. She reads it out loud.) "Dear son, Happy Festivus."                What is Festivus?  Ohhhh.. and another piece of the puzzle falls into place.  Oh, I can't believe it! I've lost my "Atomic Sub"                card!.. Oh no! I bet I wrote that fake number on the back of it                when I gave it to denim vest!  I've eaten 23 bad subs, I just need 1 more! It's like a                long, bad movie, but you want to see the end of it!  Alright, then, it's like a boring book, but you gotta finish                it.  (Irritated, and through clinched teeth) I want that free                sub.  That's a good idea.  Worked?  Oh, I remember seeing those guys picketing out there, but                I haven't seen them in a long time.  What were your.. demands?  I believe that's the new minimum wage.  So, anyway, I've been giving out your number as my standard                fake.  So, listen, when this guy calls, if you could just give                him my real number..  Ohh.. my..  My number?

Kramer, listen, I got a little phone relay going, so, if                a guy calls H&H and he's looking for me, you take a message.  Hey! I have spent a lot of time, and I have eaten a lot                of crap to get to where I am today. And I am NOT throwing it all                away now.  Maybe.  Hello, Frank.  Kramer!

(Into phone) H&H, and Elaine.  What did you do?  Oh, hi! (Waves at him)  Kramer, the vest just called.  Oh, yeah, I got a little steam bath. Listen, in 10 minutes,                I'm gonna have my hands on that "Atomic Sub" card.  (Embarrassed) Free sub. (Starts to leave) I'll see ya.  Steve.  It's Elaine.  Yeah.  I see you're still sticking with the denim. (He's wearing                a denim coat) Do you have that card that I gave you?  No, no, no. You give me your number.  No.  No.  A fake number! Blimey!  I didn't have time to go home. What are you doing here?  What are you doing here?  Hey, I was in a shvitz for 6 hours. Give me a break.  (To bookie) Hey, how'd my horse do?  Oh, hi, Frank.  (Trying to come up with an excuse not to sit with them) Actually,          I gotta get to the.. uh.. thing.  (Giving up) Okay.. (Sits, George laughs) So.. (Trying to think          up something to talk about) Frank, did George ever show you that photo?  You know, the photo I took in Tuscany of the little man in front          of the sign that said "Costanza"?  I didn't talk to anyone - I was just walking by, and I saw the          sign, and I thought George might get a kick out of it.  Who is that?  So, you weren't born here?  No, I, I don't. But.. Well, the Maestro might.  He's this guy that I went to Tuscany with. He's a great guy,          but I just wouldn't feel comfortable calling him.  (Explaining) Because he hasn't called me since we got back..          I spilled wine on his 8 by 10 photo of one of his favorite Italian opera          stars.  You know the Three Tenors?  (Nodding) The other guy.  (Just making conversation) Oh yeah?  (Mock enthusiasm) Oh, that's dynamite.  Who else is on the show?  (Interested) The Three Tenors? (Stands up) Which one?!  (Extremely excited) The other guy?!  (Screams out in joy) My God! I can't believe the other guy's          going to be on the show!  Because I ruined this autographed picture of him that belonged          to the Maestro. You think I can go and get his autograph?  (Extremely giddy) Wow! The other guy!  Who's Sally?  That's sounds pretty juvenile.  Did you see that?!  Oh, it's a poster of the three tenors.  (Blunt, to the point) No.  Eh, I like mine.  I don't want it.  (Not committing to the conversation) It doesn't matter to me.  Hi.  (Yelling out) He's got nothin'!  Well, have you ever considered writing new material?  (Getting the hint) Me? Are you talking about me?  (Reflecting) Boy, that doll was really freaky, wasn't it?  What?  Is George here?  It's.. .. you! It's really you! Oh, I'm such a huge fan of yours.          Would you mind signing this poster for me?  (As he is signing) Oh, thank you so much. (He finishes. Elaine          gives out a happy gasp) Thank you so much, Mr.. (Tries to read his signature)          Camaro. (Carreras gives her a look as he is getting up) Mr. Casea? (He          walks off as Elaine rolls the picture back up. Jerry gives his "That's          a shame" face) Well, whatever. (To Jerry) I'm gonna take this to          the Maestro. He's, he's playing at the Queens Convalescent Center.  (Mock joy) Ohh.. thank you. (Accepts the gift) Huh.. (Struggles          under the size) Wha-- why does a toothbrush come in such a big box?  (Still trying to get a grasp on the package) How am I supposed          to carry this thing? (She looks up to see Jerry taking his pants off)          What are you doing?  So?  I know you're very busy, but I just wanted to come by and give          you this.  No, no, no. Not the toothbrush.. (Holds out the poster) this.  Oh, well, I just felt so bad about what happened in Tuscany..  Oh, ok! (Picking up the Ori-dent box, she knocks over a bottle          of wine. It spills all over the poster)  Hey.  What kind is that?  Lloyd Braun? How's he doing?  You know, that's around the same time I broke up with Lloyd.          Y... you  Yeah? Well, I got news for you.  Boy, you're really getting into this aren't you?  (concerned) What? Lloyd is here?  What? No, no, I'd rather...  (big fake smile) Lloyd, yes. Hello.  (reluctant) Oh, well... I, uh, actually Lloyd, Jerry and I have          to sit  I'm sorry, but I didn't want Lloyd thinking I was leading him          on again.  Hey Kramer, you know what? There, there isn't a light there,          in the  Oh. Oh God.  Ah, I sat too close to the screen. Oh. I just gotta stretch out          in a hot  Officer. Officer, is there some reason this man has to always          be using a  Hey.  (sits beside Jerry) What?  (laughing it away) Oh God. I lost a button, so my blouse was          wide open.  Yeah, I know. I have to go check it out. It's a beautiful button          too,  Excuse me. 'scuse me, weren't you told to stop using that hose?  Well, uhm... I...  Uh... I...  No, wait! You're soaking me, you're soaking me!  Hey. Hey everybody.  (exasperated) What is Lloyd's problem?  Uhh, I got sprayed with a hose.  You know, that button looks very familiar.  I, I think that's my button. (wanders over to Haarwood) You know,          I've  Shall I undo it?  Oh, thank you.  Oh. (giggly) Tickle, tickle.  So, get this: Mister Peterman is finally letting me do                some real writing. He's got this book deal, for his autobiography.                He's gonna let me ghost write it.  Hey!  What? What happened?  Mister Peterman, thanks for having me over. Your place                isn't quite what I imagined.. (It's plain, with no sign of Peterman's                personality)  Well, (Clears throat) what part of your life (hits the                record button on a mini-recorder, and sets it down on the table)                do you want to start with? Foreign  Oh.   Well, Mister Peterman, do you want to, um..  get, um, started..  (After observing Peterman's home life) Well, I - I got                ta tell you, Mister Peterman.. I don't think I see a whole book                here.  You know, a friend of mine almost got beat up at that place                by the Van Buren Boys?  Yeah. The only think that saved him is that he accidentally                flashed their secret gang sign.  But, that didn't happen to you.  No, I - I really don't think you can do that.  You know what? Maybe I better talk to my friend.  No, uh, Kramer. I don't think -  Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob Saccamano                story?!  What happened to Bob Saccamano?  Alright, well, now that's something..  (Adding) A train is bearing down on you?!  (Reflects on the story) I don't understand.. you were wearing                the pants you were returning?  (Still confused) What were you gonna wear on the way back?  Alright, I think I got enough for one day.  (Mocking) Yeah, I'll chew on that.  Oh, thanks. I've got plans.  (Putting on her coat) Oh, you're getting together with                some of your jackass friends, and you want me to take notes?  (Sourly) I'll make a note of it.  You can't tell that story now. It belongs to Peterman.  You signed the release.  He sat in mud. Not you.  (Stern) Ya didn't! You never sat in mud!  It ever happened! Understand?  These Kramer stories are unusable! (Thumbs through them)                I mean, some of them aren't even stories! (Holds one out) Look,                this is a list of things in his  How am I ever gonna turn this into a book?  Yes! I'm a writer.  Interesting! Of course! People love interesting writing!  What? Wheren't they just here?  Maybe we could all have dinner later?  How much did you pay for them?  Oh, what didn't you like about the first chapter?  Oh, no, no! That's where it gets interesting! Don't you                see? The - the train is bearing down on you, you - you dive into                a side tunnel - and you run into a  Yeah.. yeah. I know. Um.. how about if, instead of.. diving                from the train, you.. uh, you, I don't know, you slip and, and fall                in some mud, and.. ruin your  No, no. Mister Peterman, why don't we keep them - as a,                as a reference?  What meeting?  Oh! (tries to take paper)  Yes?  All right! I'll use a pencil, Mr. Pitt.  Come in, come in!  Ah, right there, yeah.  Kramer, it's...  Kramer, Kramer, can you do this at home? I've got, I've got work          to do, okay?  Okay, Kramer, that's enough. Mr. Pitt has got work to do.  Kramer, what's wrong?  Kramer, Kramer, are you okay?  (pointing at 3-D picture) Look, there's a spaceship! That is          so cool!  (pointing) Right here.  No, no, unfocus.  (answering phone) Hello? Oh, yeah, okay fine. Uh, he'll be right          down. (to Pitt) Car's here to pick you up and take you to the meeting.  Yeah, the Poland Creek merger?  How can I go?  Mr. Pitt, I do not think that is such a good idea.  Ah. The "stock swap". Let's swap some stock. (giggles)  All right. (standing up) Hey, you guys--what's the name of the          new company gonna be?  (making a face) "Moland"?  Yeah, I know, but... "Moland"? I wouldn't drink anything          called "Moland".  Oh! Well, ah, what's in a name? I mean, water's water. Right?  Well, what did you think she was gonna do?  No, what?  What did you think, she was going to take some of that chalk          and...  Oh, come on. One thing? One thing! What?  The balance beam?  (gasps in mock surprise) Not the pommel horse?  I dunno, at least three weeks.  Jerry, that is such small potatoes. I think that I may have single-handedly          put the kibosh on the big water merger.  Yeah. Started a big name controversy.  Well, I couldn't help it. "Moland Spring"?  Well, I'm so sorry! I-  Oh, sorry. (picks up phone) Hello?  (on phone) Oh, yes, yes I'll tell him. Yes, thank you. Um, um          hold on. (to Pitt) Mr. Pitt!  Mr. Pitt! The board of directors is on the phone. They've called          an emergency meeting. They want you to be there to discuss the merger!  (on phone) Yes, hi. Okay, fine, yeah, hold on just a second.          Lemme just... (reaches into purse) Yeah, I've got it... (pulls out both          hands completely covered in black ink) Oh! Oh! Yeah, yeah, he'll be there.          (drops phone, rushes to Pitt) Mr. Pitt, you have GOT to stop staring at          that poster!  (grabs poster, smashes it) No, you don't see it, and you're never          going to see it! (grabs Pitt by the lapels, getting ink all over his jacket)          Mr. Pitt, you have to meet with the shareholders, you have to leave now.          Do you hear me? Do you hear me?!  In about twenty minutes.  Um, no.  Uh, Mr. Pitt...  Um, there's a just... (points at her own upper lip)  No?  Yeah, I'll come by after work. Hey, I got a rubber pencil                thing happenin' here.. (Sandra passes her doorway) Uh, I gotta go.                I gotta go. (Hangs up)  Could you do me a favor? Um, when my friends call, could                you not talk to them for too long?  No, no.  Oh, no, he didn't say anything.  (Calling out to Sandra) No, Sandra. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!                I really am! Listen, listen, Jerry's under a lot of pressure right                now. It's very hard being a  (Full of guilt) I know! I screwed up. It's all my fault.                Would you call her?  (Handing the phone over to him) I was just trying to help                you.  It's Elaine.  Hey, nice going, Jerome Seinfeld!  I just got a message from Sandra, she's coming back to                work.  Why? What happened? Did you talk?  Really?  Really? You really think I should fire her?  Real good!  Do you know how much money you cost me today?! 429 dollars!  I got Sandra transferred to another office upstairs, okay?!                So, she blabs to Lippman about my long distance calls to Europe!  Uh! I made a friend when I was in Europe, okay?! And we've                been in touch, and Sandra told Lippman!  (Confused) "Anything else"? What do you mean                "anything else"?  Yeah!  Why is that beautiful?  It's four hundred and twenty nine dollars!  No, no.  (Giving up too easy) Okay.  (Turns to George, he is now reading a book) Hey, what are                you reading?  (To Jerry) John Cheever, you ever read any of his stuff?  (Folding up the check) Ok, I'll leave you two alone.  (In the door way) Maybe I'll go visit my mother. She just                bought me some new panties (Jerry pauses right before sitting in                his chair) and they're - all laid  Which one is he?  Oh, yeah. I see him.  Why pass up the opportunity to go to prison?  Yeah. It is kind of cool.  I can't believe we're doing this. This is the kind of thing                they do  Really?  Yeah.  Wouldn't it be easier just to punch him in the mouth?  Oops! 'Scuse me.  Hi.  [sneezes]   Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much. [blowing nose] Really.                I mean  People don't say " God bless you " as much as                they used to. Have  So, I'm going to a nudist colony next week.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. I love nudist colonies.

In fact,                I - I  I just like to have and few drinks and just let the guy                do whatever  Well, to teach something you really have to know a lot                about it.

He he he  Yeah, I've never seen him but I feel like we have this weirdly          intimate relationship. I mean, I'm lying in bed, I'm wearing my nightie,          What? You're going to go out with my cousin Holly. You've never          met her.  At least I've spoken to my guy. You're going out on a deaf date.  Ah, . . .   Uh hu.  I think she'd figure it out.   What? What is this?  Veggie sandwich and a grapefruit? What are you turning into?  I'm not worried. It sounds like he's really good looking.  I think I can tell.  Twenty-five percent.  You're way off.   So what you are saying is that 90 to 95 percent of the population          is undateable?  Then how are all these people getting together?  (to George who is winking) What is your problem?  You keep winking at me. That's really obnoxious.  Right there. Right there. You just did it again.  You're eye still hurts?  What did he think, you were flirtin' with him?  Hello.  James! Ah, ha, Hello! Phew!  Oh, uh, ha, you've got dogs?  (mind's voice from -  ) SHUT UP! YOU STUPID LITTLE MUT          !  Dogs. Oh I love dogs.  I just don't understand it as soon as I met these dogs they started          growling at me.  Huh huh.  Uh, kind of.  I mean, she thought it was kind of strange to just order a salad.          . . . You know. . . . For a man.  You got that right.  Um uh.  I don't know. But I'm sure it had, . . . parents. Call her up.          She won't mind if you come.  Such a lovely table setting. Oh, wear did you get these napkins?  Oh, I don't remember them.  Special occassions? It wasn't special when my family visited?  What about this candelabra?  What did you do, ransack the place after she died?  I'm getting out of here. Can I borrow your jacket?  It's cold out, and I didn't bring my own. Jerry! God forbid I          should borrow one from Holly. It might have belonged to grandma Memma.          Thanks for mutton.  Down boy, nice doggy . I'm a nice person. Don't believe what          you hear.  Down doggy . oh oh a a a a a   Did you do with the dogs?  These dogs were chasing me. And no cab would stop and I had to          get off the street. Then I remembered that you lived here.  They just don't like me. It's a long story. I can tell you one          day but I can't tell you right now.   We'll have to sleep head to toe.   Head to toe.  Hey, wake up. It's 8:30 you were supposed to walk me up at 7:15.  You're a wake up guy. Don't you have calls to make?  Nah, he was tired. He had some feet in his face. My cousin Holly          is completely insane. She keeps calling and accusing me of stealing her          napkins.   I mean, why? Why would I take her stupid napkins.   They were?  Spit it out? I had dogs chasing me for that mutton. I was almost          mauled because of that mutton.   Oh, I must have left it at Jame's   Yeah but we reversed positions so there was no funny business.  Yeah, you know, head to toe.  No, because I slept with my back to him.   You know something really stinks to high h Holly! What          are you doing here?  I'm uh, I'm meeting James here. He's bringing over your jacket.  I didn't take your napkins.  Ask Jerry.  Uh, this is,  "I want you to have this job, of course the Board                of Directors is under indictment and will be  Why don't you go ahead and call him?  What butcher?  You never get good haircuts.  Yeah. You know what, you should go over there and get one                to look good for my bachelor  Oh it's a thing where they auction off dates with bachelors                for charity.  Will you go ahead? You need a haircut.  Hi. How come you're wearing a hat?  Oh yeah? Can I see it?  Come on. Let me see it.  Come on.  (still laughing, tears in her eyes) I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.  What? No Jerry, you have to go.  (dryly) Yeah, too bad.  Oh great, then you can go to the bachelor auction.  Can he fix it?  What happened? It looks the same.  Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.  You can still go.  You think?  What would you wear?  Nine hundred. Do I hear a thousand? Ladies, he is a Harvard                graduate.  A thousand. Okay, a thousand once, a thousand twice, a                thousand three times, sold to the lucky  Okay next bachelor is number, um 124 on your program. He's                uh, he's a high school graduate.  Oh, uh equivalency. A high school equivalency program graduate.                He's uh, self-employed. He's...  Oh, Kramer. Okay uh, why don't we start the bidding. Do                I hear, uh, five bucks?   So what? When someone turns twenty-one, they usually get                drunk the first night.  Tell that to my father. Anyway, guess what? Beth Lookner                called me.  What are you talking about? That marriage ended six months                ago. She's already remarried.  Anyway, Beth and her new husband Arnie have listed me a                reference for an adoption agency. They're trying to get a baby.                (Kramer and Mickey enter wearing the same shirt)  Hmm, turn around. (They turn around) Both so striking.  How did you decide which one of you would date which girl?                (They pause then look at each other)  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we got out to dinner a lot. Usually Chinese, well                sometimes Thai. And we go to the movies, Arnie's a real film buff.  Actually, I remember this one time, um, this is funny.                Um, we went to see the movie Striptease. I don't know if you've                seen... doesn't matter. Anyway, I was whispering something to Beth,                and Arnie leens over to me, and he goes, "Would you SHUT UP?!"                I mean, he barely even knew me. Where did he get ah-- But they're                nice people. (Elaine tries to smile realizing her mistake)  Why are you so concerned about this?  Hey, hey, hey!  Hey! Hold on a second. All right, look, I got an idea.                Why don't you just show up early for your next date, sit across                from each other, and see who the girls sit next to.  Beth, Arnie, hi. What's up?  Really.  Oh.  Uh, you know, I just told them what kind people you are                and, uh, yada yada yada, that is it.  You see, I don't think it is a Catholic joke. I think it's                more of a Raquel Welch joke. What was it? No, I said hand me the                buoys. (Laughing) Bouys!  So what're you gonna do?  (Calling on phone) Hey, Beth, Arnie, it's Elaine. Um, thought                you guys might wanna have lunch. Gimme a call. Bye.  Thought it would be nice.  Hey, Arnie's just as upset.  (Raising hand) I've yada yada'd sex.  Yeah. I met this lawyer, we went out to dinner, I had the                lobster bisk, we went back to my place, yada yada yada, I never                heard from him again.  No, I mentioned the bisk.  Well, I don't know. I mean, I talked to him and, blah blah                blah, he asked about you guys and, da da da da da, more questions,                bleh bleh bleh....  Again you are telling me to shut up?  You yelled that time at the movies. That's why you're not                getting the baby.  Look, I'll go down and talk to this adoption guy and I'll                make sure that it all gets worked out.  See, again with the yelling. Not a fan of the yelling.  One little baby, whatever you have in stock.  Look it, look it, Ryan. These people are gettin' a baby.                Period. Now we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the fun                way.  Hey Jerry. What are you doing here with Beth?  So they don't want a baby?  (Realizes her mistake) I think I'm gonna be sick. (George                enters alone)  Nice looking family.  Where's Beth?  Okay, well, he had this idea of a pizza place where you                make your own pie! (Laughs)  What's that?  Yep. Yeah..  (Interested) Oh?  Oh, a puffy shirt.  Uh, oh! (Remembers something they could talk about) Jerry's                going to be on the "Today" show on Friday.  Yep.. yep. Um, he's promoting a benefit for Goodwill, you                know, they, uh, they clothe the poor, and the homeless..  And the indigent, yeah.. I, I do volunteer work for them.                I set the whole thing up, and I got Jerry to do it.  Ohh, yeah. Yeah.. yep.  Yep.  Mmm  Why don't you want to take a civil service test?  Hi, Kramer. Guess what - I just saw Bryant Gumbel, he said                he might help out at the benefit!  (Between laughs) What is that?!  (To Jerry) Why're you wearing that now?  When did she, (Snickers) when did she ask you this?  I didn't hear anything.  (Just now making the matter serious) Well, you can't wear                that on the show.  (Turning around to Kramer) Wha- What? No. (Back to Jerry)                Jerry, you are promoting a benefit to CLOTHE homeless people. You                can't come out  (Arguing) Yeah, but you're supposed to be a compassionate                person! That cares about poor people! You look like you're gonna..                swing in on a  Oh, that's            O.K. I don't have much time though. So...  That was            two months ago.  Russell,            you are the president of NBC. You can have any woman you want. (picks            up the bowl of munchies on the table)  God I            hate these mixtures. Why don't they just put pretzels on the table.            Even peanuts would be good, but I don't know how eats these cheesy things            (she does).  Um...            Look Russell... You're a very sweet guy. But I got to be honest with            you. I don't like television... and that's your world. That's your life.            I mean maybe if you were in... I don't know... Greenpeace or something,            that would be different, but network television... I mean, come on,            Russell, you're part of the problem.  Oh yeah,            oh yeah. I've heard of him. He's that "Did you ever notice this? Did            you ever notice that?" guy.  Really?            What is it about?  (surprised)            What do you mean it's about nothing?  Um, I            got up. Um, I went to work. Then I came here.  Russell,            see, I'm really not interested in this stuff and I do have to go to            work (she gets up). So...  I'm sorry            Russell. I'm sorry O.K.? Bye-bye. (Russell, still sitting watches her            leaving).  So who's            playing Elaine?  Really?  Who is            it?  Oh, my            God (not in the mood to be kidding)  Listen,            was Russell at the casting?  You know,            I'm a little bit worried about him. I don't understand. We had one date            two months ago. Am I that charming and beautiful?  Why do            I keep setting you up?  (to the            waitress) Could we get a little more? (she doesn't listen and walks            away) Aghh... You know ever since this new owner took over, the service            here is *really* slow.  Mmm. They're            putting a little lemon in the tuna. I love that.  Yeah?            (we see that all the waitresses have big breasts)  Ah...  Yes, I            would say.  Do you            think it's a coincidence?  (to the            waitress) Hi. Excuse me. Who does all the hiring waitresses here?  You know            what? That's discriminatory. That is unfair. Why should these women            have all the advantages? It's not enough they get all the attention            from men, they have to get all the waitress jobs, too?  It's me.  Hey.  What's            the matter with him?  Oh...  So I spoke            to some of my sisters about that coffee shop.  So we            decided I should go over there and apply for a job myself.  Because,            it's discriminatory (she comes back wearing one of Jerry's shirt, untucked)  Yeah.  Exactly.  Who was            it?  What about            the dogs?  No, I'd            like to apply for a waitress job.  Oh yeah.            I've been a professional waitress for the last 10 years. I've worked            all over the city. These, uh, are my references. I'm sure you'll find            that I'm more than qualified.  You're            in big trouble mister. And I mean trouble with a capital 'T'. (she leaves)  Anyway            there's at least four of them, and they're all huge. And one is bigger            than the next. It's like a Russ Meyer movie.  Oh, he's            this guy who made these terrible movies in the 70's with these kinds            of women. He's obsessed. He's obsessed with breasts. That's hard to            say.  Um...            Well, there's not really much more to tell. He was looking for waitresses,            and I went in to apply for the job. And, he looked me up and down and            he rejected me.  Hi.  Hey boys!  Good. Okay, well, it's all set. I start tomorrow.  I signed up to do volunteer work with senior citizens.  Yeah. God, I can't tell you how I feel! I mean, I feel                *so*  Well, they say all it is is that you go over to their apartment                and,  Last time I had lunch with you here. You were going *on*                and *on*  Yup.  [To Jerry] What about you?  Jerry, if anybody should be doing this, it's you.  Mrs. Oliver?  Ooh!  Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah.  Did you say goiter? What goiter?  Oh, *that* goiter. Hey... Heh heh heh... Whaddya know...  Bother me? Oh, phhbt... Why would a little goiter like                that  I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't look the woman                in the  Y'know you try to do some good. You want to be a good person                but  Hey Georgie, what happened with your guy?  *How* do you get fired from a volunteer job?  I wish I could quit...  Oh, well, that sounds like a lot of fun...  Uh huh...  Well, that'll get you goin' right there...  Cows, well that's fascinating...  What?  Ghandhi?  You had an affair with Ghandhi?  Oh, my God... The Mohatma?  You know, maybe Kramer is right, some people should just                give up . I have.  I don't remember , but it certainly wasn't this. Look at                this cartoon in the New Yorker, I don't get  And you're on the fringe of the humor business.  Hey! George look at this.  You got it?  Come on , We're two intelligent people here. We can figure                this out. Now we got a dog and a cat in  The cat is saying " I've enjoyed reading your E-mail".  It's a page number.  Aahh! this has got to be a mistake.  We know what a face consists of.  Hi!  Jerry , She looks exactly like you.  Well maybe she doesn't, I don't care.  Well I've asked every one at work and nobody gets this                cartoon. I mean I don't understand why  (to George who just came in) Hey! George , Janet looks                very nice and she's quite a handsome  Enjoy. ( she leaves)  Well we're hoping that if perhaps that the catalog is a                little funnier ,people  Ahan, Ahan....yeah...Euh but, Why is it that the, that                the animals enjoy reading the email?  But, what is the comment. (she slides the magazine back                to him)  No it isn't.  I don,t think so.  That's not a word.....You have no idea what this means                do you?  Then why did you print it.  (gets up) You know what? you people should be ashamed of                yourself, you know ya doodle a couple of bears  Oh! really (laughs) well you know..... I have others  She does a full hour about how you're the devil .I got                to go see this thing.  Well I bet I can get in once I mention I'm from ...The                New Yorker.  Yes , The New Yorker , I've met with their cartoon editor                and I got him to admit that that cartoon  Then we ended up going out to lunch and he had some great                gossip about James Thurber.  ....And he said I could submit some of my own cartoons.  I do to.  It's better than your drawings of naked Lois Lane.  Well boys, I did it. I had to stay up all night but I finally                came up with a great New Yorker cartoon.  That is not the point.  Just read it!  Pretty good? Well uh! This is a gem . Kramer look it....(Kramer                stays silent).....What?  And he's saying " I wish I was taller" ha ha.                See? that's his complaint.  Do you!!!.. because that's not a normal complaint.  Everything with you has to be so .. jokey.  I wish I was taller, that's, that's, that's nice. that's                real.  I'll tell you who doesn't think it stinks , The New Yorker.                that's right. They're publishing it in their   The pig says "my wife is a slut."  Check it out, from the new issue of the New Yorker...huh!...Funny                isn't it? ( Dugan shrugs)  Can I fix that after lunch sir?  (to Dugan ) You see? You see? Smart people think this is                funny and you want to know why?  Oh! Do tell sir?  A Ziggy?  It must've seeped up my subconscious , Puddy has Ziggy                bed sheets....D'you read the comics today?  Hey look it ;Sally's cable show's on ( Kramer turns around                to leave)  Why are you yelling at the TV?  Hey! I'm just a fan..ha ha...  Bye.  I'm going to take a little stroll through the park.  Yes, his name is Hal.  It's the next best thing to being alone.  You are kidding.  Oh, yeah, that's right. Those new kitchen cabinets. How is that          coming?  Hey, Kramer, listen, you've seen the Omen right?  What exactly was that kid?  Well I don't care. It was delicious.  Wanna sit down?  Really?  Oh those places have the stupidest names. Like, uh, "Back          in ", or "Good Vertibrations".  Uh, it was okay,. He's coming over later to watch a movie. Hey          listen, what's better for your back? Couch cushions or a folding chair?          Uh, maybe we'll just stand and watch the tv. [knock knock]. I          gotta go someone's at my door. Yeah!  Yeah.  Mattress, I didn't order a mattress. Who sent this? Hal Kitzmiller?          I cancelled. Hal sent a mattress to my apartment. The nerve of          that guy.   After one date!  I don't know. Chuck it?  Oh, all right.  You have a water bed?  Well, what did you intend, Hal?  Custom designed?  Uh, that is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.  Oh, I love it. I'm glad . . . I kept it.  (on phone) Hey, Kramer, it's Elaine, thanks for bringing my mattress          back. And I guess I'll just get my spare key from you - whenever. All          right, bye.  Oh, this is a good mattress. Sniff, sniff, Ugh!   Jerry, Jerry.  What the hell is this? Where are you?  What is this. It's like you're selling movie tickets back here.  Hey, you're not going to believe what Kramer did to my mattress.          . . . I can't talk to you like this. So Kramer completely funked up my          mattress.  How did you know?   Oh, GREAT!   Hey, thanks for ruining my mattress. It reeks.  Hi.  It is obtrusive, isn't it?  I'm with you. I'm going back to my place.  I am totally loving it. Uh, you know  we should um           get going.  What smell?  No no, oh, you know what that is? I um, went claming the other          day and I forgot to hose off my boots.   Yeah, clam and scallop. I clam and scallop.  Gotta get some of that stuffed crust pizza. cheese crust pizza.  I'll tell you something. It'll be years before they find places          to hide more cheese on a pizza. Kramer!  Oh, hi. This is Hal. Hal, this is Kramer. Kramer, Hal.  You feeling jiff?  Oh, baby.  I wouldn't believe the Lumbar Yard wouldn't pick this up. Ug,          oh, okay, . . .  Jerry you gotta help me. I threw my back out.  I am lying down. I am trapped under a funky mattress. I gotta          go get a doctor or at least come over and roll this thing off of me.  Kramer.  I can't believe it. Hey, I'll meet you at the coffee shop.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hey, what are you doing?  Oh no. No. I don't want to sit in the back. I'll be left                out of the conversation.  Yes, I will, George. I'll have to sick my chin on top of                the seat.  Why can't you sit in the middle?  I think you're afraid to sit next to a man. You're a little                homophobic, aren't you?  Hello, Jerry.  Did you get a haircut?  Tell me if you think this is strange: There's this guy                who lives in my building, who I was introduced to a couple of years                ago by a friend. He's a teacher, or  And now, there's this intense animosity whenever we passs.                I mean, it's like we really hate each other. It's based on nothing.  Really?  You would do that?  Hi. (Hands Jerry the lamp)  You know, you have the slowest elevator in the entire city?                That's hard to get used to when you're in so many other fast ones.  Unless you're married to a dictator..  Right. Exactly. So I imagine at some point, somebody's                going to offer me some cantaloupe.  So, I had what you might call a little encounter this morning.  Yep.  Yep. I spotted him getting his mail. And at first, I was                just going to walk on by, but then I thought "no, no, no, no.                Do not be afraid of this man."  So, I walked up behind him and I tapped him on the shoulder.                And I said, "Hi, remember me?" And he furrows his brow                as if he's really trying to figure it  I did. I most certainly did. And he said, he goes, "Oh,                yeah. You're Jeanette's friend. We did meet once." And I said,                "Well, how do you go from that to  And he says, he says, "Look, I just didn't want to                say hello anymore, alright?" And I said, "Fine. Fine I                didn't want to say hello anymore either, but I  This cantaloupe stinks. (Spits it out)  What do you think?   Yeah, yeah like him, definitely like him. I like him a                lot.   Nothing, and I've looked.   In the office.   Yeah.   So, I was sitting at the reception desk, I was looking                pretty hot. I was wearing my sling back pumps.   Ask your mother, you live with her now, don't you? Anyway,                so then this guy comes up to me and starts feeling my jacket through                his thumb and his forefinger  I said: "So, what do you think?". And he said,                "Gabardine?". And I said, "Yeah." That was it.                Yeah...Jake Jarmel.   Hey, that's Barry. Look it's Barry.   Hi.   Oh, he doesn't handle my money, he handles Jerry's money.                He just does my taxes.   Hi, what are you doing on this neighborhood?   Wow, look at that ring.   See what?   I don't know.   Oh, no! Come on Jerry.   I have known this guy since college. He doesn't do drugs.                Maybe it's the cold weather.   Don't forget to wash your hands before supper.   Hello.... hello, oh...   You have cleaned out the whole apartment and you're making                dinner. Oh, you are a perfect, you are a perfect man.   Did anyone call?   Where are they?   Thank you. Heh, I'll call you back.Ooh, Myra had the baby!                Oh, my God that's wonderful! Who called?   She did? Oh, that's so great!   In the drawer on the right. Hmm...   Oh it's nothing.   It's nothing.   Well, I was just curious why you didn't use an exclamation                point?   See, right here you wrote "Myra had the baby",                but you didn't use an exclamation point.   So, it's nothing. Forget it, forget it, I just find it                curious.   Well, I mean if one of your close friends had a baby and                I left you a message about it, I would use an exclamation point.                You don't think that someone having a baby warrants an                exclamation point.   I just thought you would be a little more excited about                a friend of mine having a baby.   Well, you know Jake, you should learn to use them. Like                the way I'm talking right now, I would put an exclamation points                at the end of all these sentences! On this one! And on that one!                What?   Well, I felt a call for one.   I found it very troubling that he didn't use one.   He's not on drugs.   All right, here, you call him right now. See if he's sniffing                right now.   So what?   People go to South America.   So, because of a few bad apples you're gonna impugn an                entire continent?   Ok, gentlemen. The fact remains you still have no proof.                This is all speculation and hearsay.   What are you gonna do? You gonna put on a phony beard and                dress-up like Arab sheiks and sit around in some hotel room. I mean                come on...   You wanted to see me, Mr. Lippman?   Yes, krhm, yes I did.   Well, I felt that the writing lacked certain emotion and                intensity.   Right, well...   That's that's correct, I-I felt that the character doesn't                like to be ch-ch-chilly...   Well, yeah, you know how frustrating that can be when you                keep putting quarters and quarters in to machine and then *prrt*                nothing comes out...   Ok, ok ok ...   ...ok I'll just....   You still have no proof.   The sweater! The sweater made him sniff! I told you he                wasn't a drug addict.   You are really lucky Newman never mailed that letter.   What is this?   He is filing a chapter eleven. Why, what's going on, why                is he filing a chapter eleven?   What do you mean, I thought it was the sweater.   No, no. I'm fine.  (Helping him worm out of the conversation with Leo) Jerry,                Jerry. Did you taste these peas? These peas are great!  Mmm.. phenomenal peas..  I don't really eat dessert. I'm dieting.  What about ponies? What kind of abnormal animal is that?                And those kids who had their own ponies..  I actually like ponies. I was just trying to make conversation.                What time's your game?  And what time's the funeral?  How long does a funeral take?  So you cna't do both?  How can you even consider not going?  You know, funerals always make me think about my own mortality                and how I'm actually going to die someday. Me, dead. Imagine that.  Is this a waste of time? What should we be doing? Can't                you hae coffee with people?  He has to go. He may have killed her.  Oh, yeah, but I didn't say I hated anyone who had one.  Maybe she's there in spirit. How about that?  George, I met this woman! She is not traveling to any other                dimensions.  Phoenix? What's happening with his appartment?  Three hundred a month? Oh my God.  Oh, me too.  So, I understand you're moving to Phoenix?  Mmm.. gorgeous, exquisite town. Who, what's happening with                your apartment?  Oh, you can have mine. I'll ship it out ot you.. but what                about that big apartment on West End Avenue?  Dry, wet.. what's happening with your apartment?  I have an idea. Leave the winter clothing in the apartment,                and I'll watch it for you and I'll live there and I'll make sure                that nothing happens to it.  (to Jerry) Oh, Jeffrey.  Yeah, from what I understand, he works for the Parks Department.  I remember saying to myself, "Why is Jerry so far                off the base?"  I couldn't believe it when I saw you running. I thought                maybe they had changed the rules or something.  Makes you wonder, though, doesn't it?  You know.. the spirit world.  I never saw anyone play like that.  Yeah, but that doesn't make up for killing her.  here, take it  Is that the supermodel?  I thought you had a show in Ithaca.  Well, guess what I'm doing. I'm going to Mr. Pitt's, and                I am telling him that I am quitting.  I've had enough. I am marchin' in.  I'm marchin'. (Enter George)  I'm marchin' in.  This is it. Wish me luck.  Mr. Pitt, I have something to tell you.  Mr. Pitt...  What?  (Flattered) Mr. Pitt...  Oh no no, Mr. Pitt, you mustn't. You have to check with                the pharmacy before you combine anything with your heart medicine,  We don't want anything to happen to you Mr. Pitt. We want                you to live a long, long time.  What's going on?  Oh my God.  Well, he gave me the morning off, I was doing a little...                shopping. How did this happen?  Mr. Pitt, you were s'posed to talk with the pharmacist.  I'm gonna go and call that pharmacist. (She exits)  Mr. Pitt, do you need anything?  You need something to sit up. Why don't I get you a pillow?  Hello?  That's at the airport, right?  All right, all right. You sound a little freaked out yourself.  Calm down, I'll take care of it. (Ms. Walker looks suspicious                of Elaine)  I said I'll take care of it!  Kramer.  Jerry asked me to meet his girlfriend here. Did you here                about his plane in Ithaca?  Oh, our stupid friend freaked out the pilot. Single handedly                delayed the plane a whole hour. Can you believe that?  Uh huh.  Poison you? Jerry Seinfeld tried to poison you? Wha? Mr.                Pitt, what are you, delirious? He's never even met you!  Goodbye? (Elaine thinks of memories with Mr. Pitt)  It's us.  This is Aaron.  Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice?          (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?  W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.  (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)  Bye.  Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?  What is that?  Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?  What?  What?  Oh.  (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.   Mm hmm.  Aaron  Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs.          Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?   Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day          at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your          age?  You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  I don't mean to interrupt or anything, but on Sunday, my                friend is having a brunch for the New York Marathon.  She lives right above First Avenue, and says she has a                perfect view of the race. And she said I can invite some friends.  What was that all about?  What's going on? What is that look?  Something's going on here.  Jumping up and down? What are you talking about? C'mon.                Cough it up.  Would you please?  Told me what?!  (Dumbfounded) No.  No.  You didn't.  You got me an apartment in the building?!  How did you..  No.  (Thrilled) She died?!  She died!  Get out! (Pushes Jerry, he stumbles back) Four hundred                a month? Only four hundred a month?!  And I'll be right upstairs?  Right above you?  Oh, we're neighbors. I'll be here all the time!  We can exchange keys so we can come in and out. Oh, this                is going to be great!  Yeah.  Oh, I know. There's a weak shower spray, I know. I've already                thought about it, and I'm switching to baths. As Winston Churchill                said, "Why stand when  Five thousand dollars? I don't have five thousand dollars.  How am I going to get five thousand dollars?  I'm not moving in.  They want five thousand dollars now.  I don't have five thousand dollars.  No, that's too much money to borrow.  Of course I'd pay you back..  Well Jerry, it might take a while for me to pay you back.                Maybe a few years. How do you feel about that?  You know, money can sometimes come between friends.  Let me think about it.  I don't know.. I don't know. Five thousand.. let me just                take one more look at it. (Leaves)  I'll take it!  Oh, hi, Roxanne. Nice to be here. These are my friends.                This is George, and this is Jerry. (They exchange greetings) Jerry's                the one who got me my new  Jerry, this is Joanne, and this is Stan. They're in my                short story class with Roxanne and me. Hey, Jerry just got me a                great apartment in his building!  Oh, Rita come here. This is Jerry. He's the one who got                me the apartment.  So you and Roxanne are hitting it off, huh?  Really? From a distance, you seemed to be coming on to                her.  Because, I was thinking.. are you at all concerned that                living in the same building will, y'kno.. cramp our styles?  Because, I was worried that there might be a situation                in which one of us come home with somebody, it could get a little                uncomfortable. But - as long as  Wow. You're right. That is loud.  They rehearse all the time?  Boy, too bad. If I was up there, you'd never hear a peep                out of me. I'm as quiet as a mouse.  Do you ever spit on anybody from here?  No. Do you ever think about it?  Me too.  What air conditioner?  I thought you hated air conditioning. You've never had an air conditioner.  Oooh, you're getting an air conditioner for Amy. (In a wining voice:)                  Amy doesn't like the temperature up here. She's a little hoooot.  You don't have an old pair?  George, those are prescription goggles? What is there to see in a health                  club pool?  Yeah, especially those frames.  They look good. I liked the other one too. I've liked about five of                  them.  Now those look good, they're very bold.   Hi there, little doggy. (And to the owner:) Do you mind if I pet your                  dog?  Hey little doggy.  Aaah!  I'm okay, it's just a nick.  My leg looks pretty bad.  Okay.  Jerry, can we go?  Jerry, my leg.  Listen, Jerry, you just catch up with me okay? You can just follow                  the trail of blood.  Oh, come on. Cousin Jeffrey? It's not possible!  Jerry, that is so ridiculous. But, George didn't even have his glasses                  on!  So what? Squinting doesn't make that much of a difference.  Okay? That's it? I don't need a shot?  No, no, no. I know I wasn't shot. Do I need a shot?  There was a dog in front of the building and it spooked me. I couldn't                  come in until he left.   Yeah.  I'm afraid of dogs now.  Well he frightened me.  No. He said I didn't need a shot.  What, you think I should have?  All right, that's a good idea. I'm gonna do that.  You know, George, that's an union.  He couldn't tell an apple from an union and he's your eye witness?  Uhm excuse me... uh... a man came in here...  Can I just have the name...  (While reading a book:) Oh oh, listen to this, this is not good, listen                  to these symptoms for rabies: anxiety, irritability. I got those, I'm irritable!  Hey! I got bit by a dog! I had to go to the hospital! I was bleeding                  to death! I can't solve every little problem you have!  I'm sorry... sorry.  I've got such a headache. Oh, that's another symptom!  I know I don't want it! I don't need you to tell me what I don't want,                  you stupid hipster dufus!  I'm sorry, Kramer, I'm sorry.  I... I think I'm... I'm having trouble swallowing. I can't... I can't                  swallow.   Is this gonna hurt?  What if Jeffrey's not home. Did you ever think of that?  Let me tell you this: there is no way cousin Jeffrey is dating Amy.                  He looks like a horse!  Yeah, he's got a real horse face. (Elaine, while looking out the window:)                  Here, look at this! It's the guy with the dog! (She opens the window and screams:)                  Hey! You down there! Remember me? I had to get shot because of your stupid dog!  No no no no, come on, let's go downstairs.  We have to break up.  I can't take this anymore! I don't want to hear how interesting                the  Okay, alright listen. Forget about The Gap because we are                through!  Fine!  You missed quite a performance.  By making time with some floozy across the aisle?  This guy? He's an idiot. he doesn't mean anything to me.  Well maybe I feel the same way.  Ok, so now what?  I can't believe we broke up like that.  Do you want something to read?  Well, are you going to take a nap or --  You're just going to sit there staring at the back of a                seat?  That's it! I cannot take this! I mean, look at this, nothing                has  Please! I took you back. You know it, I know it, vegetable                lasagna  Ugh, I hope a giant mountain rises out of the ocean and                we just ram  Jerry.  Awful. This trip was a *huge* mistake. Huge!  It's Vegetable Lasagna.  Vegetable Lasagna!  Shut up or I'll snap you in half and stuff you in the overhead!  David, this has been the worst month of my life and if                I never see you  Oh that's origi-  86th and Broadway please.  Oh no.  Noooooooooooo!  Come on, let's go do something. I don't want                to just sit around here.  Want to go get something to eat?  I don't care, I'm not hungry.  What are we gonna do there? Talk?  Okay. I'm gonna check my machine first.  (cont.) "Picking someone up at the airport."                "Jury Duty." "Waiting for cable guy."  Oh, what is this?  I got some for you.  No, no, no, no, no, these are good. Listen,                listen: "You ran out of underwear, you can't leave the house."  How about: "You've been diagnosed as                a multiple personality, you're not even you, you're Dan."  (gives Jerry the list) Here, here. Jerry Seinfeld,                I cannot believe you're doing this. This is absolutely infantile.  Deal with it. Be a man!  You made a man cry? I've never made a man                cry. I even kicked a guy in the groin once and he didn't cry.. I                got the cab.  Wait, what pizza place idea?  Oh, that sounds like a great idea. It would                be fun.  Hi.  Oh, no, no. Tuesday's no good becasue we've                got choir practice.  We're doing that evening of Eastern European                National Anthems.  Huh... Thursday is not good because we've                got to get to the hospital to see if we qualify as those organ donors.  Hey  Whats                that?  Well,                Im sure its stupid. Its not about me, is it?  Tell me!  Yeah.  How is                it talking?  Oh I gotta                start taking these "stupid" warnings more seriously.  My Puddy?                But we broke up.  Im                doing great.   What?  David                and I   What about                you? You were even engaged, and you cut it off just like that.  You want                to bet?  50  All right.                Witness? (looks at George).  (doing                the voice) Hello-o-o-o!  (looking                VERY guilty) I went out with a (fake cough) a friend.  (looking                guiltier) No, nono.  (laughing).  Oh, you                know I wear these shoes all the time.   Its                the new look. You know Heroin Cheek?   Nothing,                nothing.   (screams).  No! Its                an isolated, sexual incident. We are   It was                no big deal OK? I mean we fooled around, then we went out and grabbed                a little dinner.   Ugh!  Hey!  No money,                I am Puddy free. So, are we eating or what?  I am   See, this                is what Jerrys doesnt understand. We can see each other.                We can see each other every day, but it doesnt mean we are                back together.  Yeah.  Well,                either way  David  Alright                thats it! Were back together!  Oh, yeah.  Get those                clothes off. Youre going to spend the night and were                going to cuddle.  You heard                me. Strip!  Still?  Alright,                here you go, choke on it (hands him money).  Yeah,                well not for long. Im breaking up with him.  Double                or nothing.  Alright,                Im out of here.  I dont                think so David, were through.  Whew that                was a dozy.  Book it.  David                I know this hurts, but its the way it has to be (Puddy is                giving her a look like hes going to still get some).  Im                going to get some popcorn.   So, how                did it end?  uh.  Listen                David, Ive got to run. Can you lend me fifty bucks?  See, this                is good. This is the way it should be. You know why are we fooling                ourselves. We belong together.  Ah nuts!  All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.  Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is         everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going         to call you back.  What? No good?  Faux pas?  Why?  Here's a thought - Bye bye.  Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was         just calling to see how your fa..   Jerry, I'm on the other line.  I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the         emergency?  That's the emergency?  I was on the other line talking to Jill.  You said it was an emergency.  So we can go anywhere we want?  Why are they doing this?  This is all very exciting.  Why Japan?  Oh - I got it - how about Russia?  It's not bleak - it's springtime.  You can't be bleak in spring.  What about Switzerland?  You're not going to do any walking.  So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.  All right! You know what, just forget it!  I'll go to Paris.  Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call         Jill one more time before we go.  Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?  All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.  Wow!  Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.  Will you turn around?  You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.  Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.  I don't know - it just is.  What is that?  What is that noise? What is that noise?  Oh my God!  What's going on?  Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!  What?  Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.  No no - me first.  Jerry, I've always loved ..u..  We're straightening out?  Okay.  Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get         back on this plane?  Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.  See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?         They can't really chase ya!  Forget it.  What? No, no - we didn't do anything.  The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?  I know.  Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.  Oh, yeah.  What?  I guess we could've called for help.  Sure - the video.  What is that?  Good morning, Jackie.  How do I look, Jackie?  Thank you, Jackie.  Jackie says put it on, Jerry.  See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They         can't really chase ya!  Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.  The Soup Nazi!  Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds         celery.  You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!  Soup's not all that good anyway.  I thought he was deported.  I think so.  I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.  I've always loved ... United Airlines.  Puddy, don't wait for me.  Why don't you just blow it out your...  If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?  Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.  I've been *dying* to see ``CheckMate''.  ``Ponce de Leon'', are you kidding me? I hated that movie!  Oh, <come on>. That Fountain of Youth scene at the                end, where   You can get a hot dog in the theater.  Kramer, Jerry is going to be here any second, and then                this line is  No! I don't want to save seats. Don't put me through that!                I once  No, George, this is the ticket-<holders> line.  Then how come we're not moving?  Can you believe him?  How long would *you* have stood in the ticket-holders line?  [gives up] Yeah, exactly...  I don't wanna go to a... miniplex multi-theater!  It's not a theater, it's like a room where they bring in                POWs to   Sigh/Ugh.  Yeah. You know, men can sit through the most boring movie                if  Oh, all right. Can you break a twenty?  Oh, well, then I'll pay you later.  Yeah, you *could*...  I mean, how is that easier? I mean, then you would owe                me twelve  Yeah.  I tell you what, I'll get the popcorn and the soda.  I will buy your popcorn and soda. We'll call it even.  [exasperated] George, you're sappin' my strength.  [in a panic] Me!? But that's three seats! I can't save                three   No, these are saved.  What, is that a rule?  [stopping someone from sitting in the seat next to her]  Can we do this later, George?  No, I'm sorry, these are taken. ...  These two and this one. ...  Oh, take 'em.  [annoyed] Excuse me, excuse me.  [momentarily shocked, as if the answer were self-evident]  Uh, could I have a medium Diet Coke?  What's the difference?  [momentarily perplexed] What happened to the small?  What's... medium?  Oh-kay. Gimme the large.  Right. Yeah. [fearing the answer] Could I have a small                popcorn?  What's `medium'?  Do adults ever order the child-size?  [laughs appreciably] Okay, gimme the `adult'.  Is it *real* butter?  [exasperated] What is it made of?  I just went to get popcorn... Ugh... [shakes more popcorn]  No no, I can't sit in the front row.  I can't stand around here for *two hours*!  [heavy sarcasm] Oh. Thanks.  Oh, hey, listen, by the way, have you seen a tall... lanky...                Oh, gimme a break!  Jerry!  George! [waves hi]  I don't know. Does this movie stink or what!  That's my coat! Gimme that. Where did you get that?  *YOU* took my seat!?  What is that stain [on my coat]?  Maybe.. All over your face!  Hi, I'm miserable. (They both laugh)  Cocktail flu.  (Angered) No, I found a better way to humiliate myself.                There was this guy, and we had a few too many..  Worse. We made out at the table like our plane was going                down!  (Gives Jerry a look) Do you know how embarrassing this                is to someone in my position?  I am an associate.  Oh God. Why did I do this? Now I'm the office skank.  (Liking the idea) Ohh.. right. Cause if we're dating, what                everyone saw was just a beautiful moment between two lovers.  (Sarcastic) Oh, bravo.  (Talking to a co-worker) Of course Zach and I have been                dating. What'd you think, I was the office skank?  "Well"? We've been dating for three months. Between                you and me, and.. anyone else you want to tell.  (Exits, closing the door behind her) Oh man. Ugh..  Yeah.  (Starts to fake cry) Yes. Oh, man! Oh!  That is correct. But here's the beauty part - now I stand                up for myself by telling everybody I'm dumping his sorry ass, and                I'm the office-  (Accepting) Alright.  Hey, that's your Uncle Leo.  French impressionism. Oh, I love this. (Looking up at George)                Now, what is the problem with this book?  How much do you want for it?  (Confused) What is wrong with this book?  (Cutting Jerry off, she stands up, trying to get away from                the book. Yelling out) Alright! Everyone clear! Bio-hazard coming                through! Clear! Clear!! (Runs  (Faking a broken heart) Oh yes. I know all about his little                performance in the break room.  (Confused) Love newton?  An addict? (Sacrcastic) Well, it just keeps getting better!  Look, uh, Mr. Peterman, the fact is that I was planning                on breaking up with Zach anyway. He was cheating on me!  Oh. Well, you know, I had planned to uh-  Hey, it's me.  (Sarcastic) Oh, that's nice. What are you up to?  My fake boyfriend is going through real withdrawals.  Eat your soup!  Why? (Zach vomits. Elaine yells out to him) I told you,                away from the curtains. Away. (Pointing) Use your bucket. (He vomits                again - this time into the  So, this book'll tell me how to get puke out of cashmere?  Great.  Yeah. Now I can break up with him. He's clean, and I'm                the office hero.  (Leaving Jerry) See ya.  (Looking up from a menu) Yeah.  Is that good?  Hey, my God, look at that. (Jerry looks over at the table.                A man and a woman are dining) David and Beth Lookner. (Leaning in                for confidentiality) You  Mm-hmm.  Well, I have to admit, I've always thought David was kind                of sponge-worthy. (Winks, making a clicking sound with her tongue)  Yeah, me too. Well, I've been waiting out two or three                marriages, but this is the one I really had my eye on.  Oh, (Laughs at George's misfortune) that's mine.  Well, my friend, Alyse, lent it to me for the week. She's                out of town.  (Overly generous) Hi, David!  God, it is so great to drive again. I miss it so much!                (Suddenly swerves to the right, then yells out of her window) How                about a left turn signal, ya moron?!  You know what? On my first road test, I hit a dog. (Jerry                nods, blinking) I think it was a golden retriever. No, no, no, it                was a - it was a yellow lab. (Picks  Oh my God! Jerry! My friend, Kim called - David and Beth                got separated last night!  They're gettin' divorced! (Quickly breaks, stopping traffic)  So, now, what is our move? What do we do?  (Agreeing) Mm.  Right.  Yeeah, but David and Beth are going to need their grieving                time.  (Nodding) Yeah, yeah..  Then why are we calling?  (Loud) Oh! (Jerry has a surprised look) I've got it! I've                got it! We're calling just to say, "I'm there for you."  Then, after a period of being "there for you",                we slowly remove the two words "for you", and we're just                (Makes a "ta-da!" gesture) "there".  Hey.  Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.  Kramer, they're painted on!  (Mock sympathy) Well.. David, it happens.  Because it's really nobody's business.  "There" is, um.. anywhere you want me to be..  And I could just be there. (Adding) For you.  Who's faking?  Faking what?  Ah! Orgasm?  How do you know?  Of course.  On occasion.  No.  Because I was gooood.  You didn't know.  You didn't know.  Well...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I faked it.  Not bad huh?  Fake, fake, fake, fake.  Uuuhm, all the time.  Jerry, listen, it wasn't you. I just didn't have 'em back then.   I'm sure they're not.  So we're having dinner tonight?  Why? What's wrong? You're not still thinking about this afternoon are you?   Nooo, the other thing.  Oh come on, Jerry. Making to much of a big deal about it.   Okay.   All right, see you later.  Bye.  Rene, can you come here a second? Let me ask you something: have you ever... you know... faked it?  Really, like when?  Yeah, well...  Hey, you know what? You wanna go see that new Meryl Streep movie?  You don't like her?  I love her Jerry, she's so authentic. I really believe everything is actually happening to her. There's no acting there.  I really admire actors, you know. It's just such an incredible skill.   What's the matter?  You're not still thinking about that are you?  Oh good.  What?  You mean...?  Oooh no, I don't think so.  Jerry, we're friends! We can't do that, it would ruin our friendship.  Jerry no, that's important to me.  Yes we will!  No Jerry, it is out of the question. You know what sex does to a friendship, it kills it.   No!  No!  What, no, it doesn't matter. Jerry, I don't care.  That is so ridiculous.  No.  No!  I still don't understand why we had to walk out on that movie.  Goodnight. Thanks for a really fabulous evening (sarcastic).  Yes I'm upset, can't you tell?  I'm really, really sorry I told you that.   Well stop being such a baby.  You're a baby!  Hi George.  No, thanks.  Just gonna return some of your things that were in my house.   I know.  I'm waiting.  Yeah I got your fins. You got my poker chips?  They're next to the fins. You got my cards?  All right and that just about... does it.  Okay, well... see you around.  All right, let's go, I give you half an hour.  Come on!  Look, Jerry, we have to have sex to save the friendship.  You know I'm a little hungry. You wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?  Won't the landlord know I'm not the daughter?  Are you coming with me?  He believes it possesses some extraordinary power over women.  Kramer!  How could you say something like that?!  No no, there's nothing wrong with her nose! I'm so sorry, Audrey.  What did you have to say that for?  Yeah? Well, you can kiss that jacket goodbye, Mr. Von Nozzin.          You encouraged her to get one.  Peter Jennings had one?  Well, I think you should accept her for who she is.  I think it's a mistake.  How do you even know the jacket is there?  Are you sure you want us here for this?  It looks good.  How ya feeling?  Can I get you anything?  You sure? Anything?  No, it didn't. No, it didn't.  Seems to be.  Shut up, George.  Yeah.  You know the only reason I'm doing this is because you took Audrey          to  Yeah.  What do I need this for?  We're engaged?  Kramer, this is too big.  Oh, uh, hi. I'm Wanda Pepper, I'm Albert Pepper's daughter. My          father  I heard him contend that.  Oh, it was a frame-up.  Oh, well, we're all proud of the work I'm doing.  How kind of you.  Daddy certainly does have an extensive wardrobe.  My father, really? I had no idea.  I found it!  Yeah, and I yelled out, Kramer! Kramer, you're killing him!"  Yeah, pretty much.  Hi!  So, will I see you later tonight?  (Aggravated) George, I just got off a twenty-three hour                plane ride. I'm too tired to even vomit at the thought.  I don't want to talk ab-ow!-t it! (She winces under the                pain from her nose on the word 'about')  She.. was.  No, no, no! It was years ago - before you met him. And,                and I got to tell you.. it was very mechanical.  (To Jerry and George) Idiots! This is all yoru fault!  (To Sue Ellen) See? See the way they are?! We're - we're                still best friends, right?  (Whispering to Jerry) Hey.  What happened last night?  (Gesturing to her nose stud) I know. I woke up with this.  (Seeing George, she walks over to greet him) Hey. (Looking                at his shoes) Are those Timberlands painted black?  (Embarrassed) I should.. (Walks tward the bride and groom)  (From the front of the room, she can hear George and Jerry's                heated discussion) Hey! Shhhhh! (Crosses herself, then shakes her                head - apologizing)  Hey! Monkeys! Knock it off. My best friend is trying to                get married up here!  (Definite) I'm not gonna sleep with you.  Would you grow up, George?! What is the difference? Nina                slept with (Points to Jerry) him, he slept with me, I slept with                Pinter. Nobody cares! It's all  George knows that you slept with Nina. That's why he was                acting so weird.  He schnapped me.  I can't tell you.  Okay. (Takes a drink) I slept with the groom.  He used to be called Peter.  Do you know what 'Jerry' is in Indian?  (Between laughs) Jugdish.  (While sliding off Jerry onto the hallway floor) Hey, what                if I got my nose pierced? That would be pretty freaky.. Oooohhhhaaa!  (Sticking her fingers through the blinds - waving at him)                G'night, Jugdish. (Laughs)  Thank you..  Oh, God, it's so hot! (Sniffing) What's that smell?  (Confused by her reaction) You are?  (Toying with the idea) Huh.. alright. I guess.  (Recognizing him) Peter?  (Acting equilly strange) No. What? Like what? What? Strange..                No. I..  Ooohh.  Oh please.. It's in the vault.  Watch this. (Puts the bottle of Schnapps in her mouth,                flips her head up, drinking it, then puts it back down with her                teeth. She is effected by that last  Oh, Mmm.. (Scoots up close to George) I'm not gonna tell                you any more things..  Okey-dokey.  (Handing George a ticket) Here. You're going to India with                us tomarrow.  Three days.  You want to go to India?  Nina? Nina? No. Psshhh.. Not weird. No. Nina.  Well, this Mischke mish-mash is just gettin' worse.  I talked with the groom's parents..  ..And it's so obvious that they don't want..  ..me to go.  So, the only reason..  ..she sent me an invitation was that so I'd send her a                gift.  Hi.  Bye.  (Gesturing back to the bedroom) Who else ya got back there?  You slept with Nina? What are you gonna tell George?  Uh. Alright, alright. I'll put it in the vault.  (Confused) What combination? (Jerry makes the "drinky-drinky"                sign with his hands) Don't be rediculous.  So what?  Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Ranawat?  Oh. Well, Usha..  (Shrugging it off) Anyway, your son is marrying my friend,                Sue Ellen Mischke..  Well..  (Soaking it in) Right. Don't go. Send a gift. I think I                understand.  (Leaving) That's fantastic.  Hi.  You're not gonna believe what I got in the mail. An invitation                to Sue Ellen Mischke's wedding.  Not the point. The wedding is in one week. I got this (Holds                up invitation) today.  It's an un-vitation! (Notices George is a few inches higher)                Hey, are you gettin' taller?  Ah. (Looking at the invitation) Hey, look at this. 'Pinter                Ranawat'.. I wonder if he's related to that guy I dated, Peter Ranawat..  What call?  (Remembers Jerry's talking about her) Oh, the great conversation                girl. (Somewhat bitter tward Jerry) The one you think can replace                me?  (Reading an invitation) India? Yeah, right. (Sarcastic)                I'm goin' to India..  (Turning around and leaving with Pinter) Hey, let's go                someplace else, Okay, Peter?  No wait, I gotta go in here and pick up Mr. Pitt's tennis                recquet.  He wanted to have it restrung. (to clerk) Here I need to                pick that up  Oh, Hi.  Yes, yes, the one I didn't get. (they giggle)  Oh, I'm not very good.  Really? Grace?  Uh, no. Not really.  Newman plays tennis?  Uh, no ... take it.  Um, I could come by your office and pick it up tomorrow.  Thanks  Bye  Have you noticed she never laughs  Yeah  See, what did I tell ya?  Oo, I better call that woman at Doubleday and see when                I can  (on phone)Hello, yeah, hi. Uh, is Miss. Landis there please.  So you're concerned.  Babs?   Hello (sees Landis) Oh, my goodness. What happened?  Oh  Oh, you'll be playing ...  There are plenty of things you can do, there's chess and                uh uh mah jong,   ... and biking and ..  ... hiking ...  (sees racquet) Could I ...  (sees racquet), You know it's not important I'm gonna,                ok, well, you know.  I told you I couldn't. The woman was crying about how she                might never   augh, he's got a big match tomorrow with Ethyl Kennedy  He'll only play with his racquet  That's stealing?  I know.  JERRY: Hey  Ah, I'm ready what?  You found out Kramer's first name?  JERRY: Cosmo?  JERRY: Cosmo  Cosmo, Cosmo?  COSMO?  It's not such a bad name.  Uh, no, I'm OK.  Um, it's mine. Miss. Landis borrowed it.  No no no, I can. I can. It's mine. It's my racquet.  All right. I'm going I'm going  Give it give it ..  All right all right forget it. You don't have to mention                any of this to   No, I got caught.  Her assistant caught me. And now I'm probably not going                to get a job.   Meanwhile Mr. Pitt's got this match with Ethyl Kennedy                this afternoon.  Hi Cosmo  Actually, I've got some work I gotta do, so...  Well, I don't know about "gold."  'Baby'? What, are you doing George now?  Well, I don't know, don't ask me any more questions about jokes,          Jerry, it puts too much pressure on me.  Yeah, who's he?  Hi.  Yeah, how about her?  Yeah, she's a package full of something.  Oh yeah, she's a great laugher, Jerry. <imitates Toby>          Really, really great!  What about her kid, is she bringing him, too?  Fine... <Toby sits and waits for Elaine to speak.> How          are you?  Nope.  Knopp? Really? Boy. That means there's an opening here for senior          editor...has Lippman, uh, hired anyone?  Really!  Oh...well...  No, really.  I mean, stranger things have happened...  Well, you shouldn't get your hopes up, Toby.  Really.  I'll tell ya why. Because of her pinky toe, that's why. Because          Lippman felt so sorry for her, he didn't want to hurt her feelings.  Sure, the pinky toe is cute! But, I mean, what is it? It's useless!          It does nothing. It's got that little nail that is just impossible to          cut. What do we need it for?  Why don't you just shut the f-  Yes, I heard, Kramer - I work there, remember??  Oh, wonderful!  Oh, of course! She's deranged.  Jerry, George, what are you doing here?  *gasp* My god! My watch! You found my watch! (pushing Jerry)  Where did you find it?  And you stopped by just to give it to me?  I though I'd never find it.  No. Today's *your* lucky day.  You want to work here?  Yeah one of the readers left and there's a job opening.                Dick, this is Jerry and this is George.  (softly to Dick) Dick.  My boss told me to find someone. I'm in charge of it. All                you have to do is meet him. Come on. Come on, come on, here hold                my drink.   And vodka.  Where's my drink?  No, no, no, this is just cranberry juice.   Dick? He can't drink. He's an alcoholic. I told you to                hold it.  One drink like that and he could fall right off the wagon.  He's acting very strangely. I think he started drinking                again.  No. I can't smell it.  You don't always smell someone from a drink.  What about one drink? Would you smell it from one drink?  I suspect that this guy I'm seeing might be drinking but                I can't smell it.   Maybe we're too close to the bottle.  Hey what's that?  Christmas present? For who?  *gasp* (pushing George) Get out of here.   (opening the present) Oh George, this is beautiful. Is                this cashmere?  Oh, I love cashmere.   My, George this must have cost a fortune.  Jerry, how could you let him spend so much money?  George, this is one of the nicest things anyone has ever                given me.  What?  Uhh. This. It's like a red dot.  What don't you know?  Well do you see it or don't you?  Do you see it or don't you?  You're still here. You're a dynamo.  I'll see you tomorrow.  Dick was fired.  You knew he was an alcoholic. Why'd you put the drink down                at all?  I'm not saying anything.  What could I be saying?  If I was saying something I would have said it.  I said it.  Nothing. It's exhausting being with you.  Hey, let me ask you something something. Did George buy                that sweater knowing the red dot was on it because it was cheaper?                (Jerry is unconfortable) Ooookay, you just gave me the answer.  Yes you did, yes you did. I saw your expression.  How much did he save?  Hey George, did you buy that sweater knowing that red dot                was on it because you could get it at a discount?  You did didn't you.  Well Jerry told me that you did.  You had sex on your desk with the cleaning woman.  No. I once made out with someone but that was it.  Well that's not sex.  Kissing is not sex.  Hey, did Jerry leave that drink next to Dick's on purpose?  What are you doing here?  Hey Jerry when do you consider that sex has taken place?  So, George told me that you left the drink next to Dick's                on purpose.  Oh my god that's Dick. It's Cape Fear.  Ow, ow move over.  I've got no room.  All right, thanks for the ride, Kramer.  Oh, I forgot to call Jill. Jill. Hi, it's Elaine. How is your father? Is         everything okay? What? I can't hear you so good. There's a lot of static. Wha? I'm going         to call you back.  What? No good?  Faux pas?  Why?  Here's a thought - Bye bye.  Jill, hi, it's Elaine. Well, I'm calling from my home. Indoors. Well, I was         just calling to see how your fa..   Jerry, I'm on the other line.  I'm sorry, Jill. I'm going to have to take this call. Jerry, what's the         emergency?  That's the emergency?  I was on the other line talking to Jill.  You said it was an emergency.  So we can go anywhere we want?  Why are they doing this?  This is all very exciting.  Why Japan?  Oh - I got it - how about Russia?  It's not bleak - it's springtime.  You can't be bleak in spring.  What about Switzerland?  You're not going to do any walking.  So then you'll walk down the hill and we'll pick you up.  All right! You know what, just forget it!  I'll go to Paris.  Hey. NBC limo is downstairs - beep beep beep. {NBC tune} I'm just going to call         Jill one more time before we go.  Well, I can't call from the limo. Can I call from the plane?  All right, I'll just have to call her from Paris.  Wow!  Will you shut up? You are ruining the whole trip.  Will you turn around?  You are annoying me sitting like that. It's effeminate.  Yes, I think it's a little effeminate.  I don't know - it just is.  What is that?  What is that noise? What is that noise?  Oh my God!  What's going on?  Oh my God, we're going down. We're going to die!  What?  Jerry, I gotta tell you something too.  No no - me first.  Jerry, I've always loved ..u..  We're straightening out?  Okay.  Well, what are we going to do about Paris? I mean are we actually going to get         back on this plane?  Well, I'm sure that they would fly us first class.  See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. You know?         They can't really chase ya!  Forget it.  What? No, no - we didn't do anything.  The Good Samaritan Law? Are they crazy?  I know.  Alright - um, excuse me, hi, could you tell me what kind of law this is.  Oh, yeah.  What?  I guess we could've called for help.  Sure - the video.  What is that?  Good morning, Jackie.  How do I look, Jackie?  Thank you, Jackie.  Jackie says put it on, Jerry.  See, the great thing about robbing a fat guy is it's an easy getaway. They         can't really chase ya!  Oh, hi, I'm Elaine.  The Soup Nazi!  Five cups chopped porcini mushrooms. Half a cup of olive oil. Three pounds         celery.  You're through, Soup Nazi. Pack it up. No more soup for you. Next!  Soup's not all that good anyway.  I thought he was deported.  I think so.  I hope it's not that one, because I cannot wear orange.  I've always loved ... United Airlines.  Puddy, don't wait for me.  Why don't you just blow it out your...  If I call Jill from prison, do you think that would make up for the other ones?  Cause you only get one call. The prison call is like the king of calls.  Yeah...   I know, I'm glad I got to see him before he hit puberty and got,          you know all lurchy and awkward.   Tomorrow evening, sure.   Do I know anyone??   Can you believe that, Vivian doesn't think I'm responsible?   I couldn't raise a kid? Come on, I love bossing people around.          You just left? What did you tell her?   I think you're getting a little pudding under the skin yourself.          Hey, working out?   Vivian left me a message. I guess a certain someone changed her          mind about whether someone was responsible enough to watch certain other          someone.   No.   Vivian, hi it's Elaine. Yeah, I'm over at Jerry's, I got your          message...What? Yeah, he's right here, hold on...[hands the phone to Kramer.]          You? I'm more responsible than you are!   Kramer...   It is me, you idiot. Hi, all right you've got to get out of here,          I'm gonna baby-sit the hell out of that kid.   No no no, you're out, I'm in. Now, hit the road.   Kramer is actually sleeping one off, so I thought that I'd help          out...[Kramer moans from the bushes] what's that, some raccoon or something...[hits          Kramer with a broom.]   Hi Jimmy. [Jimmy kicks Elaine to the shin.] Ouch! [The screen          door hits her in the head.]   I wish I was dead.   As long as you don't put...   Thanks for the re-fill.   Oh, he's...he's a joy...   Oh, handful of sunshine. I wish I could do this every day.   It's not serious, is it?   Oh yeah, that eh...that is nice to know. [Pours the juice from          the bag back to glass.]   Hey.   Oh, just great. I found out that Vivian has some kind of medical          problem and if the worst happens she wants me to take care of Jimmy.   It doesn't matter. If anything happens to her, I'm on deck! Scissors          mishap, air show disaster, chinese organ thieves...it's a dangerous world.          Oh, hi, oh God. I didn't here you come in.   I don't know, I don't know...we had HoHos for dinner and then          eh...and then he put this plastic bag over his head and started running          around until he got tired and then he laid down somewhere I...I tell you          I'm no good watching that kid.   No! I'm a scatter brain. That's why I probably can't hold a job          or keep a man!   All right, but I'm running out of purses here. [takes her purse          from a punch ball.]   Jerry, I tell you; if this woman dies, it is going to be a major          inconvenience.   I mean I can't shake this woman. You know, now I have to go to          Jimmy's birthday party.   No matter what I do, I cannot weasel out of raising this kid.          Yeah, that's what I need; a pinch weasel.   Vivian...   Hi! This is my friend George.   I'm gonna go say hi to Jimmy.   So how long did they drag you?   Hi George. Hi Jimmy.   Couldn't he just take the D straight to Coney Island?  Ok, what time is your job interview George?  All right, I'm gonna go.  9:30  Yeah, they flip a coin.  Yeah.  I can't. I'm the best man.  See'ya.  It's ironic.  This, that we've come all this way, we have made all this                progress,  Oh...  A wedding.  Yeah  You're telling me.  Oh, very nice.  She.  There is no he.  Em, two women. It's, eh...lesbian wedding.  Aha, yep. I'm the...eh...bes tman.  No, no, no, you don't understand! I'm not a lesbian! I                hate men,  Too bad.  Get that out of my face.  George?  Here, pay. (Gives the check to Jerry)  Hey!...( sees George) HEY!! Georgie. You know what I just                realized; the wedding is like a month  What?...Oh! by the way. What am I going to be in the wedding                party?  Well Jerry's gonna be the best man and Kramer's gonna be                the usher so what am I gonna be?  Wel...I have to be something. I 'm a close friend....What                about being a bridesmaid.  Well then...aaahh how about being an usher?  You don't ask.. You tell.  Start smoking.  Really?  Yeah! You're probably right.  No! Not me pal. I can't keep this up much longer. I'm sick                of being single.  Yep! just you and Kramer.  So I'm not gonna be an usher?  So I'm nothing. Jerry is best man , Kramer is an usher                and I am nothing.  Jerry ( as they come into the apt.) Jerry, Susan says I                can't be an usher at he wedding.  Aaawh...This is GREAT!!.....Now I'm gonna be stuck at the                singles table with all the losers.  Did you try the cigarettes?  I wouldn't sign one.  I wonder what happened?  I'm so sorry George  All right. (they start to leave except Jerry)  Oh, hi Greg.  Yeah. Well, today was the first day I worked out since the Central          Park Mini-Marathon.  No, but I exercised that day. <Laughs.>  Yeah, I guess as an airline pilot, you're one of the few people          who can say that and mean it. <Laughs again. Greg looks at her, unamused.>          Um, do you have the time?  Oh.  No.  I'm just waiting for my friend George, we worked out together.  Yeah, nice to see you, too.  Let's make it fifty.  Alright, listen to this. Remember that guy I was telling you          about at the health club?  Yeah.  I waited, he didn't show up. Anyway, this guy gave me an open-lip          kiss.  So? We've always just kind've pecked. This one had a totally          different dynamic.  Yeah. I mean, his upper lip landed flush on my upper lip. But          his lower lip landed well below my rim.   Yeah. Definite moisture.  Yeah. Listen, I think he's giving me a big signal...maybe he          wants to change our relationship. <The buzzer sounds, Elaine answers          it.> Yeah?  Hey, what happened to you?  Well, what was it? I mean, I was waiting.  Because, he doesn't pay any attention to me, and he ignores me.  I respect that. <George enters.> Mmm, what happened?  Yeah? What was it?  You went...in the shower?  Ever hear of...holding it in?  How do you know?  I can find out.  Sure. <Thinks -   Oh, thanks. <Thinks -   <Thinks -   Oh, yeah, sure. <Hands Greg her bottle.>  It was nothing, forget it. <George enters the gym.>  So what do you want me to do?  How can I do that?  Are you kidding? That's very significant! If he was interested          in me, he'd want my germs! He'd just   George...but if I ask him now, I will have no chance of going          out with him.  I...I don't know...  No, that's not it!  Why couldn't you just wait?  Since when is a drain a toilet?!  Different pipes go to different places! You're gonna mix 'em          up!  No, you look pale.  Hi, Greg.  I got the machine next, buddy. <Greg finishes up his workout          and gets off the machine.>  Never mind that, look at the signal I just got.  Lookit. He knew I was gonna use the machine next, he didn't wipe          his sweat off. That's a gesture of intimacy.  Listen, George! Listen! He knew what he was doing, this was a          signal.  Yeah! It's a social thing.  No! I won't be a party to this.  Okay, I'll talk to him. But you're putting me in a very difficult          position. <Walks away.>  You're really working up quite a sweat today, huh?  Are you sure you want to do that?  You're interested in...in her? <Points at the manager.>  Ah. You know, uh...I'm engaged. <preens> Yep, gettin' married          in fifty years. <Snaps the straps of her leotard against her chest          and winces. George walks by the manager.>  You know, Greg, I wouldn't do that if I were you.  Well, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't it a violation of club          policy to not wipe down a machine after using it?  Yeah, well, at least he had a drain.  Over you?  I got him a two-line phone.  Never even seen you? Gotta kinda envy that...  [Proudly] Really?  Hey, who do you think is the most unattractive world leader?  All time.  I dunno. You ever get a good look at DeGaulle?  I got news for you. Golda Meir could make 'em all run up                a tree.  Y'know, just because you two are homosexuals, so what?                I mean you   Hear what?  Yeah, you know people ask me that about you, too.  And you get along well with women.  I gotta go return something...  Thank-you.  So she kept insisting I take off my coat. I refused, and                then she  Yeah...  It's us.  This is Aaron.  Oh, that is soo nice (very elaborate nice) Aaron. Isn't he nice?          (to Helen) So listen has Jerry been showin' you a good time?  W-well I don't think so Aaron, uh, I have plans.  (under her breath) Ya that'll happen)  Bye.  Why would he ask your parents to go to a museum?  What is that?  Have you ever heard of anyone doing anything like this?  What?  What?  Oh.  (putting on lipstick) Sorry pal, wish I could help you out.   Mm hmm.  Aaron  Uh, let me ask you a question. How come you asked Mr. and Mrs.          Seinfeld to go to the museum with you?   Uhuh, um you didn't feel uncomfortable spending the whole day          at the museum with two complete strangers who were more than twice your          age?  You had fun with Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld.  The back? They never find anything in the back. If they                had anything good in the back, they'd put it out in the front.  Yeah.  I'm not so sure he wants one. (Customer leaves) Hey, don't                forget Sunday, okay? You and George are coming, right? Hotel Westbury,                eight o' clock.  What? What, you don't want to go now?  No, Jerry, you have to. I need a buffer. You know, I haven't                seen my father in a while and.. you know.  So, that's why we're not togeter anymore.  Try it on. (Feels it) Wow, this is soft suede.  (Shocked) Oh my God.  You have no idea.  No idea.  There is no park and the team has relocated.  Oh man, that is a beautiful jacket, though.  Well, it's just a lining. You can always have it changed.  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Where is Dad?  Kramer, that .. Kramer! I'm just about to leave, he calls                me up. He begs me to sit in his car for two minutes, so he can pick                up these birds..  Well, he said he'd drive me here right after. So, I am                sitting in his car twenty minutes! he doesn't come down. I am freezing.                Then a cop comes by, tells me  Good. 'Cause Dad can make some people a little uncomfortable.  Man, Kramer! I could kill him.  He said he'd give me a lift.  Oh, Hi, Dad.  No one.  Fine.  Yeah, I'm reading manuscripts for Pendant Publishing. I                told you ten times.  Ohh.. it's snowing. It's beautiful.  Yeah.  Okay.. (To Kramer) Hello. (To Jerry) Listen, thanks again                for coming last night. Dad said he had a great time.  No, he's driving back to Maryland tonight.  (To Jerry) I didn't want to tell you this, but usually                he hates everyone.  (To Jerry) Yeah, he like you though. Said you reminded                him of somebody he knew in Korea.  Dad thinks George is gay.  No, he pretty much thinks everyone is gay.  (Pointing at the jacket Kramer's wearing) Isnt' that..?                (Jerry nods) Oh, is this fromt he snow last night? (Jerry nods again)                Ugh.. you know what you  (awed) Oh, look at this!  (excited) Oh, cool! Look at that!  (excited) That is a Schwinn Stingray!

Still killing me from having to get that bike off the wall.   (sitting) Ah, I think I really strained it. Ow.  Ach, maybe.  I don't know.
