(Eyes glued to the TV) I guess.  Sometimes we don't get what we want.  I didn't get my transfer.  To Hawaii. The most sought-after postal route                of them all. The air is so dewy-sweet you don't even have to like                the stamps.. But it's not to be - So, I'm  Kind of. I'm still collecting checks, I'm                just not delivering mail.  And yet, it's perfectly legal to take a man's                soul and crush it out like a stale Pall Mall.  Jerry!  (Urgent) I need that mail, where is it?!  The guy who had the Hawaii transfer got busted                for hoarding Victoria Secret catalogues. I gotta deliver that mail!  Blast! There's no way I can handle 8 in addition                to my ususal load of one! I'll never get to Hawaii! (Moves over                to Jerry's couch, depressed) I'll be  I usually do. (Gets up to leave) See ya.  (Intrigued) What are you proposing?  An alliance?  Kramer bit me!  We had an arguement about me going to Hawaii,                and he locked onto my ankle like it was a soup bone. I'm hubbled!                I don't think I can do my route -  You?! (Laughs hysterically) You can't deliver                mail!  (Thinks for a moment) I guess you're right.                It's just walking around putting it into boxes..  I could give you my uniform from my rookie                year.  "Do not bend". (Laughs evilly) Just                crease, crumple, cram.. you'll do fine. (Phone rings. Newman answers                it) Hello?.. This is he. I don't understand..  That was the Vice President of the post office.                I didn't get the transfer.. They knew it wasn't me doing my route!  (Stands up) Too many people go their mail!                Close to 80%. No body from the post office has ever cracked the                50% barrier! It's like the 3-minute mile!  Exactly. You're a disgrace to the uniform.                (Newman takes off Jerry's mailman hat. Jerry turns his head in shame.                Newman then tears the post office  (Realizing) Damn!  <laughs>El Paso!   Are you married right now?  I told you he was a risk.  Yeah? Well, you bombed! That story stunk worse than these                chairs!  Lately, though, I've been, uh, - I've been buying the generic                brand of waxed beans. you know.   We've got no one!  What about a guest-host?  laughs  Go girl!  We made quite a haul.  Well, I'm not paying the five cents for that stupid recycling          (taking bottle) Refund?  I don't know, they're deranged.  (peering at bottle label) What is this 'MI, ten cents'?  Ten cents!?  Wait a minute. You mean you get five cents here, and ten cents          What d'you mean it doesn't work? You get enough bottles   You tried it?  I don't understand. You fill an eighteen-wheeler?  I wanna learn. I want to know why.  So we could put the bottles in a U-haul. You know, go lean and          (to Kramer) That's where my missing soda is.  Damn!  (triumphant) Yessss!  Ahaha!  Come on Kramer!  It's the truck, Kramer. The truck!  No, no, no, no no. Listen to me. Most days, the post office   But, on the week before holidays, we see a surge. On   The mother of all mail days. And guess who signed up for the          (excited) We carry a coupla bags of mail, and the rest is ours!  (triumph) Let the collecting begin!  Come on, are you ready? Let's go!  What's the matter with you? I just talked to you fifteen minutes          ago.  The courthouse. You gotta go with me to the courthouse. I'm contesting          a ticket today.  You gotta go with me. I mean, you-you're my alibi. You have to          take the stand.  Well, let me remind you of something. You wouldn't be here if          it wasn't for me and my helmet. I saved your life! You would be dead!          Dead! You would cease to exist! You would be gone for the rest of eternity!          You wouldn't even begin to comprehend what that means!!  Okay, you're all set? You got your story?  When the cop stopped me, I told him that I was rushing home because          my friend was about to commit suicide.  Now, you're that firend. Now, all we need is a reason why you          were going to commit suicide.  No! That's no reason to kill yourself!  Every night I sleep in a really hot room, I don't want to kill          myself.  No, no, no. That's not gonna work. Something else.  Banker! So you're killing yourself because your dreams of becoming          a banker have gone unfulfilled. You-you-you-you can't live without being          a banker.  You must be banker.  I had gone up to Westchester. I go there every Tuesday. I do          charity for the blind in my spare time for the Lighthouse. I was in the          middle of a game of Parcheesi with an old blind man and I excused myself          to call my friend as he was very depressed lately because he never became          a banker.  You see, it'd been his lifelong dream to be a banker and he uh,          just the day before he was turned down by another bank. I believe it was          the Manufacturer's Hanover on Lexington and 40th Street. That was the          third bank to turn him down so I was-I was a little concerned. I wanted          to see how he was doing. Well, Your Honor, he was barely audible. But          I distinctly recall him say...  So I sped home to save my friend's life and I was stopped for          speeding. Yes, I admit I was speeding but it was to save a man's life.          A close friend. An innocent person who wanted nothing more out of life          than to love, to be loved and to be a banker.  No sir. He did not. But only by thge grace of God. He's in the          courtroom today  You know what I mean.  And why was that?  All right, all right. Go ahead, go ahead.  Okay.  And that failure to become a banker was eating at you. Eating-eating-eating          at you inside.  It was your family that pushed you into banking , it was their          dream for you...  Your Honor, I'm only trying to establish Mister Kramer's fragile          emotional state, my entire case depends on it.  As you were saying, Mister Kramer...  You're telling how your parents pushed you into banking.  But you never became a banker, did you Mister Kramer? Why? Why          did you fail?  It was because you hated your father and you would do anything          to displease him. Isn't THAT true?  Yuh, yes. I intend to Your Honor. And then, on the afternoon          of September 10th, you received a phone call did you not?  Yes, a phone call!  From me!  Yes, from me!! I called you remember?  Yes, I called you, you idiot! Because you were going to... You          were going to... Remember?  You were going to...  Yes, the banker!!!  A banker! A banker! Your Honor, Your Honor, Your Honor...  Your Honor, Mister Kramer's obviously very distraught.  You're off your rocker.  Crazy Joe Davola?  Pilot? So what do you make for something like that? Fifty? Sixty          thousand?  Yeah.  Deh!  Hey! What are you doing? It's after six o'clock! You can't give          me a ticket! Hey, you're not gonna get away with this. I'll fight this.          I got witnesses.  One large jambalaya, please.  Thank you. [inhaling deeply] Jambalaya!  [panting] Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!  Something's happened with the Soup Nazi!  Elaine's down there causing all kinds of commotion. Somehow                she got  He's giving away what's left! I gotta go home and get a                big pot!  I cant eat fruit. It makes me incontinent.  Hello Gina. Hello Jerry.  Hello Jerry.  I hope he stays this happy when he wakes up.  No reason.  Ill bring him up to date.  Oh, all the way up.  Well, it would take a hell of a lot. Because a friend is something          you earn.  I dont care much for the beach. I freckle. . . . Is that          a,..  Wow, where did you get that?  Boy, thats the full size.  Can I have a bite?  Just one bite?  All right! All right. I wont say anything.   I swear.  On my mothers life.  Oooh,   Jerry, you better stop her or Ill tell.  He did it right in this bed, Martin. Right in front of you.  It was disgusting.  Hilarious.  To prevent an ambush.  Wallet.  It's Newman.  I can't believe I'm being evicted.  The reverse peepholes. Silvio said I'm an agitator and                I'm out of the building.  I'm homeless! I'm gonna be out on a street corner, dancing                for nickels. I'll be with the hobos in the trainyard, eating out                of a bucket.  Uh, you, uh, you better put something on.  Well, there's very little sleeping going on.  Quite frankly, I don't see how it's any of your business.  Hey, what is that up that tree?  No, that's a fur coat! Hey, uh, give me a boost.  The Pacific Northwest.  So, to what do I owe this unusual invitation?  Ahh! This is very much as I imagined it to be. Aside from                this rattan piece, which seems oddly out of place.  This isn't about my opening your mail?  Because I don't, never have, anything I read was already                open.  Sorry. Climbers, keepers.  You are?  Well, it's-it's interesting work, I don't mind it.  Don't you have a-a boyfriend? A, uh, burly, athletic type?  Cool?  Oh, how I've waited for this moment. But alas, my heart                belongs to another man's wife, and I have given the coat to her.  For I am in love with Svetlana, and I don't care if the                whole world knows, except for Silvio, who would throw me out of                the apartment, where I would be  Nice place you got here Kramer a man can really get some                I don't know. The man makes a pretty strong bird.   Yea, it's the wood that makes it good.   Uh-Huh.  It's getting cold, it's getting cold.  Why do we have to keep this a secret from Jerry?  Number 67, right here, right here!   Hello Jerry.  I love broccoli, its good for you.   Gladly.   Vile weed!   Yes, now please. Someone, honey mustard.   Hello Elaine. Where are they?  All right, I'm going to need a clean 8 ounce glass.  If I'm curt, then I appologize. But as I understand it,                we have a situation here and time is of the essence.  This stuff is awful! I'm not Newman!  Hello Jerry. Well, I may have a solution to our little                problem.   I have a private matter to discuss with my fellow tenants.                (Opens  Look, sister, go get yourself a cup of coffee, all right?                Beat it!  Nevertheless, sometime this afternoon, behind the Market                Diner, an  Jerry?  Like Silkwood.  That's right.  We'll pay anything. We've got the (hands a wad of money                to Kramer)   I hear you've got some lip reader working for you. You                gotta let me use her for one day. Just one day.  But Jerry, we've got this new supervisor down at the post                office. He's working behind this glass. I know they're talking about                me. They're going to transfer me, I know it. Two hours, give me                two hours.  (Sinister) All right, all right. All right you go ahead.                You go ahead and keep it secret. But you remember this. When you                control the mail, you control... information.  Not so fast pretty boy . There is more to this sorted little                affair .   You might say that.  Well, tootle loo. And nice seeing you again Margaret, goodbye          Jerry. Have fun. Hehe   Who is it.  You've come at a bad time now. Could you come back later?  Hellooo Jerry. What a rare treat. What brings you down to the          east wing?  There's no need to get excited. Can't we discuss this like gentlemen?  Do you really want to know what happened? I'll tell you what          Happened. She wasn't my type.   Not really.   Ah, she just didn't do it for me.   Well, h ha ha- if you're happy with her, that's all that matters.  No. I need a really pretty face. But, Hey, that's me.   Care for some lemonade?   Drop bye anytime, jerry. Hah, ha ha   You lookin' for someone?  Coy? I'm not being coy.  Alright, go ahead and hit me, Seinfeld. I got witnesses.  George?  Help! Help!  HELP! <Elaine enters.>  They're gonna beat me up!  You wanna know what happened to Kramer? I'll tell you what happened          to Kramer. He was ticked off. About the keys. Yeah, that's right - about          the keys. Thought he got a bad rap.  Yeah. From you.  You heard me. So he packed it up and split for the coast. La-La          Land. L.A.  Hello jerry. What a pleasant surprise.  Fleas? Bwa ha ha ha ha .That's preposterous. How can I                , give you fleas. Now if you don't mind...  So , you have fleas. Maybe you keep your house in a state                of disrepair. Maybe you live in  (Cannot take this torture anymore) Baaaaaaaaarrhhhhhhhhhhh....I'm                ripped with fleas ( scratches  What for, you got your own.  ( resumes eating) Well that's a shame.  You can't taste 'em . Why waste 'em . Why not give them                all to me.  Sorry , last one . Would you want to suck the pit?  Kramer!  I'm on the roof!  I can't. I'm goin' to the movies.  Once I find a barber I stick with him. I almost went to                barber school. I always felt I had a talent   Yeah, just the way that I was raised. I'm special.  It's okay. A little crooked.  What's the catch?  Hmm, that job sounds like it might be worth a *year's*                free haircuts. And a comb.  It's Newman.  Can I use your bathroom?  My toilet's clogged.  No.  He's out.  Yes, yes. Can I go? Cause I gotta go very badly.  (thinking to himself) (checks a comb) No. (checks a brush)                Jackpot. I don't believe this.  Yeah, yeah.  What are you doing?  Oh, can I watch a little? It's my favorite movie.  No.  Gotta go. Oh gee, I dropped a nickel (reaches down and                picks up the hair.)  It was a cinch. Where are you going?  Kramer?! Kramer!? Where are you? Kramer!?! Kramer!!?  Jerry, George. [To Kramer] So, did you ask him about the                records?  You know Ron's Records down on Bleeker? They pay big cash                for used  I'm a United States postal worker.  Sometimes...  Because the mail never stops. It just keeps coming and                coming and  Well, you know how much those records are worth!?  Those records are worth more than five dollars!  You're gyppin' us!  They follow him like a cult.  I don't like it.  Alright, well be back... *jack*!  Five dollars. He offered us *five* dollars.  That guy thought we were a couple of total squares.  [In Kramer's ear] The old coot's sittin' on a mountain                of gold!  Twenty bucks?!? Are you out of your mind?  Take it or leave it!? We got *Al Jolson* here, *Al Jolson*!!  You are nothing but a piece of crap.  A piece of crap.  I find you extremely ugly.  You emit a foul and unpleasant odour.  I *loathe* you.  Make us!  It was a real melee.  Wayne Knight  Excuse me Miss Weaver , OH! My god it is you! I.. I've                seen your show six times..  Aahh! You're great ,It's great , It's so great to see a                show that's (looks at Jerry) about something.  Hey, hey...   Hello Jerry. So, any news?   South America?! What kind of snow blower did you get us                mixed up with?   If we put our three heads together we should come up with                something.   It's Thursday.   Tuesday has no feel. Monday has a feel, Friday has a feel,                Sunday has a feel....   Hey, you know this is kind of fun.   Yeah, me too.   Hey, hey maybe I should go with him?   Who made you the leader?   I've should've gone in with him.   What you need me in the car for?   I use dental tape.   I don't wanna.   No.   Why, because I use dental tape?   No, no I don't like it.   I like the thick tape.   Will that take care of ours too?   Hey, you want me to mail it? I'm on my way out anyway.                It'll be my pleasure.   See'ya later.   After you.   Pair of bear claws, please.   Hello, Jerry.  You know, old friend, sometimes I ponder this silly gulf                between us and  Damn you Seinfeld. You useless pustule. Um, somebody's                got something  Butter?  How much longer you gonna be, I'm starving here.  The smell. It's still with you, huh?  I'll meet you at the coffee shop.  Butter. Kramer. Butter. Kramer.  Hee hee! Yeah yeah!  I'm sorry I missed that.  Here. Hold this.  Hello, Jerry.  I was speaking earlier with Kramer and he mentioned something about a private         jet to Paris?  Well, I hear it's quite beautiful there this time of year, and of course you         know I'm one-quarter French.  Oh yes, in fact I still have family there. This probably won't interest you,         but I have a cousin there who's suffering very badly. She's lost all use of her muscles.         She can only communicate by blinking. I would so love to see her - bring a ray of sunshine         into her tragic life. But alas, I can't afford it, for I am, as you know, but a simple         postal worker.  Take me! Take me!  All right! But hear me and hear me well - The day will come. Oh yes, mark my         words, Seinfeld - your day of   (Gesturing to dishes and silverware on the table) But you                can clear some of this stuff out of the way.  He's shipping us a rickshaw. It can't miss!  It's the romance of the Handsome Cab without the guilt                or dander of the equine.  Yeah, but I though-  Can't we worry about them later?  (Pondering Kramer's plan out loud) They do have an intimate                knowledge of the street..  Alright, who's first?  Name, please.  (Writing on a clipboard) Rusty.  (To Rusty) Alright, uh, take it down to the end of the                block. Make a controlled turn, and bring her back. Let's see what                you've got! Ok? Ready, and  (Yelling out to Rusty) Alright, pace yourself, 'Cause you're                gonna have to do this all day for very little money.  I think he stealing our rickshaw!  We gotta find that rickshaw. You check the sewers and dumpsters.                I'll hit the soup kitchens, bakeries, and smorgasbords.  (From outside the room) Kramer? Kramer? (Enters Jerry's                bedroom) There you are.  I just heard that a postman spotted a rickshaw down in                Battery Park.  It's entirely possible.  (To Jerry) Good night.  There it is!  Uh..  You know, when you think about it, it's kind of silly for                us both to pull this thing all t he way back uptown. I mean, after                all, it is a conveyance.  So, which one of us is gonna pull?  (Realizing he won) Yeah.  Mind your pace, Boy. Chop, chop!  Well, don't tarry. I'm behind schedule as it is.  (Scared) Boy.. Boy. Kramer!  Ahhh! Yaaaahhh!  Waaaaahhhh!  (With a gorgeous woman sitting on his lap) Did I?  Aww..  (Suggesting Jerry) Does yours?  (Kissing the woman) Beauty.. and brains.  (To his new girlfriend) You see, my dear, all certified                mail is registered, but registered mail is not necessarily cerified.  (Sputtering loudly) Kramer! I'm with people.  I did invite you.. Your invitation must've.. gotten lost                in the mail.  (Refusing, Standing up) Can't do it. I'm on an unbelievable                birthday-wish hot streak! My last five birthday wishes came true.  (Negotiating) Your next.. fifty wishes.  Fourty-nine.  Alright, alright, back, savages. Back! I haven't made my                wish yet..  Hi Babs  Minding my own business.  What makes you think I'm lookin' for trouble?  ha ha ha Well you know sometimes it just has a way of  We din, we didn't ... ... Cosmo?  Hello, Jerry.
