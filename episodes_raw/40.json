Oh my god...I did it again.\" They tell you \n        it's something mechanical, because they don't want to come on the PA system...\"Ladies \n        and gentlemen, we're going to be delayed here on the ground for a little \n        while, I uh...Oh God, this is so embarrassing...I - I left the keys to \n        the plane in my apartment.\" You see the technicians all running underneath \n        the plane; you think they're servicing it, but they're actually looking \n        for the magnet \"hide-a-key\" under the wing...\"maybe he \n        left it up there somewhere...\""]},
