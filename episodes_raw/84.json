I'd probably get lost, have to go back to the room, \n        check the map again...and they always tell you, no matter what, whatever \n        you do in a hotel fire - do not panic. Hey, I got four minutes to live, \n        I've never panicked in my whole life - it's my option. Even if they find \n        you, you have a perfect excuse...'Gee, I heard they saved you swingin' \n        from the shower curtain naked with an ice bucket on your head.
