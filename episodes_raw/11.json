According to the information that I have in the envelope that \n        I've received, it seems that I may have already won some very valuable \n        prizes. Well, thank you, thank you very much, well thank you. It's very \n        nice to hear that. But, in all honesty, I have to say, I didn't even know \n        I was in this thing. But, according to the readout, it looks like I am \n        among the top people that they are considering. You know, that's what \n        annoys me about the sweepstakes companies, they always tease you with \n        that, \"You may have already won.\" I'd like once for a sweepstakes \n        company to have some guts, come out with the truth, just tell people the \n        truth one time. Send out envelopes, \"You have definitely lost!\" \n        You turn it over, giant printing, \"Not even close!\" You open \n        it up, there's this whole letter of explanation, \"Even we cannot \n        believe how badly you've done in this contest.\""]},
