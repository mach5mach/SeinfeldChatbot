Women need equipment. I don't know what \n              they need. I know I don't have it, I know that...Ya know what they \n              need, women seem to need a lot of cotton-balls. This is the one \n              I'm, always has been one of the amazing things to me...I have no \n              cotton-balls, we're all human beings, what is the story? I've never \n              had one...I never bought one, I never needed one, I've never been \n              in a situation, when I thought to myself: \"I could use a cotton-ball \n              right now\"...I can certainly get out of this mess...Women need \n              them and they don't need one or two, they need thousands of them, \n              they need bags, they're like peat-moss(?) bags, have you ever seen \n              these giant bags? They're huge and two days later, they're out, \n              they're gone, the, the bag is empty, where are the cotton-balls, \n              ladies? What are you doin' with them? The only time I ever see'em \n              is in the bottom of your little waste basket, there's two orthree, \n              that look like they've been through some horrible experience... \n              tortured, interrogated, I don't know what happened to them...I once \n              went out with a girl who's left a little zip-lock-baggy of cotton-balls \n              over my house. I don't know what to do with them, I took them out, \n              I put them on my kitchen floor like little tumbleweeds. I thought \n              maybe the cockroaches would see it, figure this is a dead town: \n              \"Let's move on\"... The dating world is a world of pressure. \n              Let's face it: a date is a job-interview, that lasts all night. \n              The only difference between a date and a job-interview is: not many \n              job-interviews is there a chance you'll end up naked at the end \n              of it...ya know: \"Well, Bill, the boss thinks you're the man \n              for the position, why don't you strip down and meet some of the \n              people you'll be workin' with?\"."]},

Men, I mean, men are with women. You see men with women. How \n              are men getting women, many people wonder.

We're honking our horns to serve \n              you better."]},
